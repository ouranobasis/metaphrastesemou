STARSHIP SONG TWENTY-THIRD
(Mandys' deception and escape. The arrival of the timekeepers
and their interference. Nemo, Frant and Tondo's
hunt for Mandys)
Then I called a meeting and addressed the companions,
asking them for advice about Mandys and his sheep, 
and I then said these powerful words to my comrades:
"Now listen to my speech, all you good fellows.
5 Our cosmic mission is now apparently over.
We now have Mandys and we are holding him in handcuffs,
the sheep on this one also with the planet must be inhabited by him.
Although we don't know now which of the many it would be,
but we know for sure that it is here on an astroid.
10 But Mandys would love to show us which sheep it is,
because we have methods to convince the enemy's mind .
But even if Mandys didn't tell us which sheep,
that's also a sure thing, because Mandys doesn't have her any more.
But now I also want to know your irrevocable will,
15 whether we should kill Mandys straight away with pregnant fejzers,
let he will tell us the sheep, whether he doesn't want it,
or carry him to Earth there through the abysses of the empty cosmos,
to our own country and city and our base,
so that the judges will judge him and also give him punishment
20 according to our laws, so as is generally proper."
Then the fellows themselves agreed in their opinions
first to convince him to show us the sheep,
but then to kill Mandys there immediately with malignant fejzers.
But then Mandys himself began to speak to us with a speech:
25 " Listen to my speech now, even though you are very angry, friends, 
because you have no advantage from killing me, 
but only from having the sheep that watches the universe.
And I will show you here, because I have none of it anymore profit,
and I will also show you where the mine is of dense gold.
30 But know, all of you, that the entire star is made of gold,
hard, completely pure — for it is not the work of nature,
but a certain being, very rich and very clever ,
by technique she made and sent the cosmos into the void,
so that she would not have to give the gold to her relatives
35 one day, when she also dies and the wealth will be divided.
But now the gold is hidden under a layer of manure
and it is difficult to dig it out, because manure it completely covers them.
But I will show you the beautiful gold mine,
if you let me sail away into space without the sheep.”
40 And the comrades themselves took the brave heart,
and wanted to have the gold and let Mandys go,
but to first show them the sheep in the flock.
And to me, when I considered it, it also seemed better that way,
and as Mandys suggested, we let him do it.
45 He showed us that sheep and also the gold mines,
 a boat then entered his and flew into the boundless space.
However, I used a luminous color on this sheep,
I wrote on its wool that it is she who sees the universe.
Thus yellowish gold even the best bewitches men.
50 They came out we then went to that mine to quickly dig up some gold
with great joy in our hearts, that now our reward is rising
to the pilgrims of the starry paths, how much we have suffered,
and also compensation for what the evil Kyptus stole from us.
But for myself, my soul she did not rejoice
55 because of mammon; I'm a cynical philosopher, 
but that the comrades wanted to dig there very violently
and so the gold stopped their minds from the rebellion.
But their pickaxes couldn't dig the gold
with their little ones, because the gold was very hard there,
60 didn't even use phasers, they didn't want gold for that, 
so that we might not run out of phaser ammunition before I get home.
However, engineer Burda and Tonda, a technical robot, made 
semtex blast-carrying for the good fellows.
They started throwing out the yellow semtex gold,
 65 terrible strong explosions sounded all over the star,
the sheep then ran in all directions in great fear.
But the one marked as the one who watches the universe,
somehow fell into a trench there and broke her neck,
she died quickly afterwards, however nothing happened in the cosmos.
70 I took the killed sheep and showed it to my companions,
and when they marveled at it, I said to them the mighty words:
“Now listen to my speech, you comrades, I will tell you something.
I found the all-seeing here sheep killed here
in a ditch by a kind of steep; she apparently broke her neck,
75 but nothing happened after that in the abyss of the cosmos.
Apparently she wasn't a true and proper cosmic sheep,
but the sly Mandys had shown us a bad one.
But stop, dear, now yellow cocking baby,
 for it is necessary to find the proper and proper sheep for us, 
80 nor greed must blind your eyes now, 
when you take gold, for necessity is pressing upon us.
This to me, as I thought, seemed best to be:
The sheep that watches the universe, she can never sleep for sure, 
because she is always looking at it, otherwise all things
85 could not exist, because they are, that the sheep is looking.
Now we need to divide the fat sheep
 and a small flock of them always assign to one man, 
whether he is born normally, or made, or synthetic,
to watch them diligently for the whole twenty-four
90 of our earthly hours, because the sheep must also sleep.
Which of these sheep in the flock will not sleep for him,
 it must surely be the one who is still watching the universe.”
Thus I said, and they immediately listened to my words.
Immediately they shared the fat sheep, hither and thither
95 and everyone immediately began to look at the small herd,
born, artificial also, both a robot and a human.
Sitting there like this, we waited to see what would be awake.
But then sleep fell on our eyelids,
for men and robots too, because those who have consciousness
100 need to turn off their brains, just like born humans.
However, when I woke up from that delicious sleep swoon,
I suddenly had the feeling that I heard a rocket in the distance.
I immediately woke everyone else up from their sleep as well.
We began to count all those we were guarding , sheep,
105 as we had already counted them before when they were divided
in their great herd: This they did now again.
But now one sheep was apparently not in the herd.
An inextinguishable lament arose here for all my fellows,
knowing that we would again away the end of the mission fled.
110 However, when they closed their hearts with pitiful weeping,
to them, having made a meeting, I spoke the fleeting words:
"Listen now to my speech, even though you suffer a lot now, comrades,
before us again lies the one across the cosmos the depths of the path, 
We must chase Mandys and the sheep that follows the universe. 
115 The path is both difficult and easy, so surprisingly it became true. 
It is a difficult path, because Mandys wishes to go back 
to the past time and endanger life in the present, 
so you need to catch him before that happens.
But it's easy again, because we already know his path,
120 that it is heading towards Earth and the time that has passed on it.
But let's quickly get into a well-made ship,
let's fly up into space and leave the astroid behind."
But, while I was still speaking, a very strong voice arrived on the megaphone
 from above, from the depths of the sky.
125 All my comrades were frightened, even myself, the captain of the ship
and the sheep, in great fear, ran in all directions.
But that great voice spoke the words of the fleet
in our own language — apparently it was an interpreter with them: 
“Listen now to my speech, you thieves, men, bastards,
130 because we, the guardians of time, happen to be here again.
We have come to take back our time-weaver from you,
so now it is necessary to give it back to you , what you took.
If you don't give us back the knitter of that time,
I will destroy your astroid with the ship with phaser cannons,
135 but you can't escape the big cannons,
then give it back to us immediately, because you are certain to be destroyed! "
Thus said a great voice and our hearts broke.
I immediately spoke to my companions in hidden words:
"Listen now to my speech, even though you are suffering a lot now, comrades.
140 Now you will have to delay the guards a little
until I'm not going to board the boat of that ship of ours
with the robots Franta and Tonda and those two devices,
that is, with the unraveler and the fast time cutter,
to chase Mandys and the sheep that watches the universe.
145 However, as soon as they see that I I'm fleeing the planet, 
they will start chasing, those guards, just me alone
and they'll leave you alone, because you're not important to them.
I'm sure they won't even have the intention of punishing you somehow, 
because the time unraveler stole the robot from them because of Franto,
150 but the he will be in the boat and he will sail with me after all.
But now you have to return to your native Earth and home
the only task left is, and rejoice in that, comrades.
But now I will appoint the wise Burda as the captain.
Well, now start to delay them with yours words." 
155 This is what I said, and Burda immediately began to talk to them 
using the radio and the guards heard him. 
However, the robot Franta made a recording of that voice 
on a tape recorder, in the language of the guards of the boss, 
who loved Franta, so as I said before.
160 However, when we then entered our boat alone,
Franta the translator and Tonda the technical expert
and I, who carried with me the terrible technique of the time,
Frantík's voice began to speak to the boss there
softly, cuddly begging him with words not to do anything bad
165 to Franto, nor to his friends, the destroyers of the walls,
and as a reward for that he promised him his eternal love.
The chief of the guards hesitated and did not know what he should do;
but I with my boat and two good fellows
 up we took off into space leaving the astroid behind
 170 Mandys racing and the sheep watching space.

“Listen now to my speech, you thieves, men, bastards,
130 for we, the guardians of time, happen to be here again.
We have come to take back our time-weaver from you,
so now it is necessary for you to give back to us what you took .
If you don't give us back the time knitter,
I will destroy your astroid with the ship with phaser cannons,
135 but there is no way to escape those big cannons,
then give it back to us immediately, because you are certain to be severely destroyed!"
So he said a great voice, and our hearts were broken.
I immediately spoke to my companions in hidden words:
“Listen now to my speech, even though you suffer much now, comrades.
140 Now you will have to hold back those guards a little
until I get into the boat there that ship of ours
 with the robots Franta and Tonda and with those two devices,
that is, with the unraveler and the fast time cutter,
to chase Mandys and the sheep that watches the universe.
145 However, as soon as they see that I am fleeing from their planet,
 they will start to chase, those guards, only me alone
and they will leave you alone, because you are not important to them.
They won't even have the intention of punishing you in any way,
because the time untwister stole the robot from them because of Franto,
150 but the one in the boat will be and he will sail with me, after all.
However, now you have only one task left to return to your native Earth and home
, and rejoice in that, comrades.
But now I will appoint the wise Burdu as the captain.
Well, now start delaying them with your words.”
 155 That's what I said, and Burda immediately started talking to them
using the radio and the guards heard him.
However, the robot Franta made a recording
of that voice on a tape recorder, in the language of the guards of the boss,
who loved Franta, as I said before .
160 However, when we then entered our boat alone,
Franta the translator and Tonda the expert in technology
and I, who carried the terrible technology of the time,
Frantík's voice began to speak to the boss there
begging him in a soft, caressing word, so that he would not do anything bad to Frant
165, nor to his fellows, the destroyers of the walls,
and as a reward for that he promised him his eternal love.
The chief of the guards hesitated and did not know what he should do;
but I with my boat and two good fellows
