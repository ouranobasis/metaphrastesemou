STARSHIPS CANTO TWENTY-FOUR
(Capturing Mandys and the Sheep.
Poems twist and end)
For a long time we sailed there through the chasms of empty space,
Mandys racing and the sheep watching space.
I steered my boat alone across the bottomless chasms of space,
towards to our sun and our mother Earth, 
5 knowing that Mandys is also going to return there now. 
Soon I also saw him on the sensors of the image plate, 
and when I saw him, even my stout heart spurred 
and here I am he addressed him on the radio, saying:
"Stop, Mandys, running away, because I'm already close to you
10 and now I'm going to shoot you with a phaser cannon to your destruction.
You don't even have a chance to run away from my boat,
which is sailing fast here , because I'm certainly faster than you.
Well, stop running away and give me back the stolen sheep,
then sail away with the gold, wherever your heart prompts you,
15 if you don't want to, I would hit your ship with a deadly phaser."
Thus I said and he mockingly replied to me again: 
“You are certainly stupid, Nemo, and destroyed by the cosmic journey,
if you think that I will give you a sheep, as you talk about it.
If someone would perhaps want to capture me or cause me to die,
20 I believe that I can destroy him with the help of this sheep. 
If I were to kill this sheep, it would be the destruction of all 
creatures living in the cosmos and space, matter and time, 
but now turn the running ship around and go back, 
because you cannot catch me Mandys very crafty."
25 That's what the man Mandys said and I fired a phaser at him.
Strong Mandys had a boat and nothing happened to him,
except that the boat shook and a manly thief inside.
Immediately his vessel disappeared from my screen, 
and then I realized that a section had sunk in another time,
30 but I didn't know the time in which Mandys sunk in,
because surely anyone could have chosen Mandys.
And then my mind wandered here and there as I pondered. 
Finally, I remembered the words of Grogal frozen,
that Mandys will run away as in the past time
35 because of his yonder gold and wealth, the gold that begets
on our mother yonder Earth. And here it probably seemed to me, 
that he would want to escape the end of the twentieth century
Mandys the hideous, probably, because it seemed the best
for him: to have a lot of gold, he could live richly,
40 but enough technology, he could have a pleasant life.
And so for a test, I just set the time for the knitter,
so that he would throw me into the twentieth century,
but the same day and month, as well as the year,
how earthly I was now, when I was sailing through the cosmos.
45 But, as I was doing it, the darkness covered my eyes, 
and already losing strength, I gained awareness, 
that apparently the sheep had stopped looking at today's universe, 
for it is in the past and certain that my doom will come. 
But I still pressed the button of the device myself.
50 I immediately woke up again and was alive in the boat of black
I saw Mandys again, floating in front of me,
fast with her agile flight. My dear heart leaped there.
Add now the force that drives the vessel through the cosmos,
I began to pursue there Mandys, the thief with the sheep.
55 But it was very difficult for me to catch up with the man,
since before me long ago he emerged in the cosmos,
 and the fact that I thought for a long time what I should do then. 
Although he had a small ship,fit only for one man, 
but steered easily and fast for space travel,
60 but I was very far behind with my space boat.
So we carried ourselves through the depths of space
toward our sun and our mother Earth,
 at the end of the twentieth century, at that time. 
However, I did not have the ability to catch up with the man there, 
65 before he braked his agile boat into the orbit of the Earth. 
That was when Mandys, the manly thief, was caught, 
and I spoke to him on the radio words:
"Stop, Mandys, running away, because I'm already close to you
and I have the possibility to throw you back into the future time,
70 from where you started running away and I'm looking for you in the universe.
But in the future time, as you know that it has already happened, 
many are astronauts and many spaceships,
which I will be able to gather here very quickly
with the help of a radiophone: This is certain to be a terrible doom for you.”
75 So I said, and Mandys said nothing more to me manly, 
but my fast boat hit me with a phaser cannon:
However, I fired again and the boat also hit his.
Both vessels, however, now the phasers hit our 
devastating; doom was imminent for both of them. 
80 But now I saw the sensors on the screen 
Mandys in a spacesuit, how the ship is already leaving fast, 
the crate on her back, in which the rocket drive is hidden, 
at the same time as the sheep itself, the she had her own space suit
— or maybe the Skafovs — because Mandys took great care of her.
85 He flew with her very quickly down to mother Earth
but now of course he apparently left the gold in the boat!
However, the missile also destroyed my vessel very much, 
and the air quickly began to escape from our boat,
a terrible cosmic frost began to creep in,
90 and there was no longer any way to steer our boat.
When I saw this now, my heart broke,
I immediately took off my spacesuit on the body as quickly as possible, 
but I put the skunk in Franta's helmet, 
so that he would have warmth and air, because he was made of living tissue. 
95 However, the robot Tondu, which was only made of hard metal, 
only I took it with me, because it was a mechanical robot.
I jumped out of the ship and fell into a dark abyss,
with the help of a rocket I flew and steered it towards the Earth.
It all happened quickly and a strong necessity hit.
100 So we, the drivers ship, they both descended to Earth.
But when I finally landed on Earth from space,
I immediately took off my spacesuit very quickly
and took the robot Franta out of his helmet again,
and then we waited some more, until the frozen unfreezes Tonda
105 and when he becomes energetic again, he becomes an over-wise robot.
But when the robot Tonda regained consciousness,
we climbed onto his back and quickly fell through the Earth,
Looking for Mandy and the sheep that watches the universe.
Because he was Tonda that robot just like a big spider
110 made of steel; his legs were too long, as well as his arms,
 his body was like a ball and there were many sensors on it.
 He was running very fast and the interpreter was carrying me.
 As soon as possible, and then as I will finally tell you now
 about the Mandys chase and also his and the sheep?
115 Only about this epic could be big and long,
if I wanted to tell everything that happened, there during the hunt.
Which motorcycle did Mandys steal first,
then a car and finally a helicopter,
and how we chased him, as fast as possible
120 different ways, including in the air and on the open sea.
It would be too long a word and difficult to say.
Eventually we caught him and ran away he no longer had the option.
However, now pulling a too-sharp tow from his pocket,
he put it on the sheep's neck and spoke in this way:
125 "If, Nemo, now you put your strong hand
on these sheep of ours, either you or some robot ,
I will quickly kill the sheep and with it the whole universe!”
So he said. But my sweet heart broke,
when I saw the whole cosmos so close to danger.
130 But the robot Franta said something to me secretly
send a little message to my receiver,
which I had behind my ear. Then I rushed out suddenly, 
and then I hit the sheep on the head with a kind of stick.
The sheep immediately fainted and fell to the ground senseless,
135 but the treacherous Mandys was terrified with a terrible roar.
But nothing happened to her in the cosmos, not on the spot, 
because he stole the wrong sheep behind the all-seeing one,
and left the right one on the asteroid.
But when the guardians of time came to the asteroid,
140 cannons started firing at him with 140 deadly phasers.
He shuddered whole and the darkness covered their eyes, 
for they made the all-seeing sheep swoon there, 
the right one, because Mandys left it behind there by mistake.
But this is how they knew that it was all true, 
145 what I told them then in the base on their base,
and immediately there they made peace with my good fellows.
They went out again to look for us there on Earth in the past,
namely me the captain and my robots both;
but now they connected with the wise Franta by radio,
150 and they also told that there is no such sheep on Earth.
But they wanted to pick me up with my robots in the Tatras...

You already know the rest , because it was the beginning of destruction — 
But the cosmonaut Mandys had to stay there on Earth, 
losing all the gold and the sheep that follow the universe, 
155 and also his own time — it was a difficult lot for him. 
He accepted a kind of place there, as they say in the Greek text, 
for he had to eat after all. He was wicked and very bitter.
With him there remained a sheep that was not all-seeing,
to comfort him and to unite with him in love.
160 But we have now provided the story for you,
men of future times, just as you asked of us ,
Captain Nemo has told you everything he has experienced so far,
but to you too, Franta, the interpreter of speech;
I am the one who composed the story for you here in verse and speech
165 of the ancient Argeans of old, because this is the best way to
tell about planets and sailing and dangers.
You then, father, rejoice in that poem about traveling through space,
it is not just science fiction, but it is fact and truth,
but now we want to get on a space ship,
170 and then fly up and leave mother Earth
and that time is foreign to us and return to our own.
he put it on the sheep's neck and spoke like this: 
125 "If, Nemo, you now put your powerful hand
on this sheep of ours, either you or some robot,
I will quickly kill the sheep and with it the whole universe!"

when I saw the whole cosmos so close to danger.
