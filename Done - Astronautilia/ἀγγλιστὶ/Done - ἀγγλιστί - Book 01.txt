Astronautilia  A
(Prelude. The matter concerning a sheep observing the universe, and concerning Mandys. The beginning of the Astronautilia)


"Begining at first I beseach greatly the chorus of Muses on Helicon and lord Apollo the beautiful leader of those Muses and also god of poets, that he would speak the matters of my journey through the cosmic void, the wonders of planets, and also the great deeds of men."

"Which things pointing out we sail through the gloomy chasm, 
I ship's captain, and my faithful comrades,
seeking Mandys and the sheep that observes the universe.
Tell us you all now these things, oh god or goddesses!
Where might I receive a begining and what should I tell first?

You ask, who I am, and you seek my renown name.
Therefore, I shall tell you. Since I come existing in the future,
you might not be able to pronounce my name, and this is difficult."
But for your sake, I wish to be called in another way.
precisely Captain Udeis let me be named,
as in books, a mysterious daring man they call
and in Latin Captain Nemo
Call me thus now, translating it, for all days.
I am an officer of the law in a future city,
lord of police and also commander. All police officers 

in that city of beautiful towers trust in me.
But sorrow has come to me, and also a difficult task."
"But where shall I obtain a begining and what first shall I tell?
This matter is difficult to understand, even I understand it poorly.
They say there are painful equations among the physists.

A proof of quantum theory besides anoying lines of difficult equations show that there must be a being who observes the universe.
However, if there were no creature constantly watching the universe,
the cosmos of broad paths would not be able to endure,

not time, not space, not matter, nor anything else.
but an overseer always is necessary to have, to oversee.
sho among mortal men would be able to take hold of this?
and wisemen speculated continuously about the cosmic observer,
what kind of creater and lifeform it would be, watching the cosmos.

36But a result did not appear to those pondering.
but then the matter revealed itself just by chance.
There was a certain shepherd indeed in the shady mountains,
who of course going about guarded his fat sheep.
And this was a museum of agriculture existing formerly,

41men refer to it also with the term skansen.
certain sheep he had wandered on the road, being angry he grabbed a rock,
he threw toward the sheep he hit its curly haired head.
Immediately, consciousness left, darkness covered his eyes.
He awoke from deep sleep, he frequented the way with the sheep,

46 not thinking anything great concerning those things which occured to him, a man.
But there in a village under those mountains shady,
a certain doctor lived a man healing all,
men and women and the children and grandchildren.
Him the shepherd saw concerning a sickness of another woman,

51 but while talking of this, he mentioned the things also concerning the sheep.
The doctor, a man, asked about the duration of the fainting spell,
and finding out, much awe seized him, it shook his limbs.
For many others had arrived with the very same complaint,
that darkness had covered their eyes at such a time.

56 Even the doctor himself fell into a sleep in this time.
Thus, the matter seemed cursed, evoking terror.
But of course, to the shepherd he said nothing of these things,
the doctor gave him a pill and sent him back to tend his sheep.
But peace had left his mind in his heart,

57 it kept pondering and turning this way and that."
"This village doctor had a disciple of a certain kind,
of that kind commonly called by the name 'physicist.'
One evening, he conversed with him at his wine table,
as the sacred light of the sun had already set.
But he also told him about the sheep and the shepherd,
how suddenly darkness had covered everyone's eyes
at the moment when the shepherd had struck the sheep on the head.
The sage rejoiced and was alarmed, for he already knew
that the particular sheep was the being that watches the universe.
He immediately told this to the doctor and explained his theory.
They immediately went into the mountains, driven strongly
by the desire to unravel the mystery and of course, by curiosity itself.
They found him by the fire, and around, the fat sheep
with woolly fleece were bleating and grazing on the grass.
They asked the shepherd in urgent words,
seeking the sheep that he had struck with a hard stone.
And the man showed it to them and did not conceal the sheep.
They pounced on it and caught it—it was too large—
and then they immediately inserted a certain glass vial under its nose,
from which hypnotic vapors rose upward."
"Immediately, a destructive darkness veiled the sight of both men,
until the mystical sheep rose from the darkness itself,
or, when it stopped looking, everything disappeared as well,
the animals, as well as people and all things in general,
all that exist and are there in the depths of the cosmos,
namely space, time, energy, and matter.
But when the sheep awoke again, the one that watches the universe,
immediately all things appeared again and were,
namely space, time, energy, and matter,
all that exist and are there in the depths of the cosmos,
the doctor and physicist and also the man who tended the sheep,
the sheep and the boundaries with the fire and the shady mountains.
The wise men rejoiced that they had found the mysterious being,
who watches the universe and had grasped its essence.
They immediately seized the purchased sheep from the shepherd's hands,
joyfully carrying it to their magnificent house.
First, they called the ruling men who govern our land,
and immediately conveyed the news to them over the phone.
It was wondrous and immense, as well as frightening,
to control and rule the sheep that watches the vast universe.
For whoever owns the sheep, holds the greatest power
over the entire universe completely, for the power to utterly destroy
everything that exists there in all the depths of the cosmos,
namely space, time, energy, and matter.
The ruler of the universe becomes the one who owns the sheep,
for he can control them all; only, if he were to kill the sheep,
he would also lose his own life.
For this reason, they told the rulers about the sheep.
Thus, sorrow and great work came upon me as well.
For the police then guarded the cosmic sheep,
but I, their commander and ruler of all the guards,
bore responsibility for the watch of all the guards.
From there, my head ached, and sleep fled from me."
"I introduced many technical devices into the guard space,
which were only conceived in the learned minds
of men: television and other new inventions,
eyes and ears, and also other additional sensors,
technological. Above all these things, a powerful computer ruled,
in which intricate programs were stored.
('Computer' is what the British men call it,
but the Greeks call it 'hypologistés.')*
This computer ruled over all technological inventions,
all sensors, and also powerful locks.
No mortal man could steal the sheep.
So I pondered, yet, foolishly, I could not perceive
that an evil fate would strike me and surely a powerful one.
There was a man here who was knowledgeable in electronics,
experienced, one of those whom people call 'experts.'
He had control over the locks of the sheep in the guard station,
over all the sensors, and even over the hypologist himself.
His name was Mandys, and all the ruling men called him Mandys,
as did his good comrades."
"The most despicable man came into the sheep guard.
He was hunched and limped, and his head
was bald and lumpy, and as for his nose,
it was enormous, resembling a ripe fig,
and both his eyes were like large balls,
such as small children often play with on the meadow.
So Mandys was, the most repulsive of all people,
who had ever come to guard the cosmic sheep.
Other men often laughed at Mandys here,
because of his appearance. This troubled his dear heart.
But he sought revenge on all of them, evil in his deep mind,
certainly to all the guards who watched over the sheep, but
also to all the people and indeed all things.
For he stole the sheep with his cunning mind,
knowing the arrangement of all that guarded the sheep in the guard station,
both the technical and the men who were guards of all shifts.
He took the ship to the cosmic sheep. And surely again
he propelled that dark little ship into space,
flew into the universe, and left the fat earth behind.
And then sorrow and difficult work came upon me,
for the rulers were angry with me, the powerful men.
At first, they wanted to hand me over to the judges,
who would condemn me and throw me into prison
for many long years and for many too many days
to eat unpleasant food there in harsh chains,
but they took pity on me, for I had been their friend.
They changed their decision and came up with another plan.
They sent me now in the ship into the dreadful empty cosmos
as captain, along with the other guards as well,
who allowed the sheep, which watches the universe, to be stolen,
strictly commanding me and laying heavily on my heart,
not to return until I caught both Mandys and the sheep.
Thus they spoke. Our dear hearts broke
observing the vastness of the empty cosmos,
Mandys with the sheep, and the whole impossible task."
"At least I begged those noble-headed rulers
not to send us into the depths of the empty cosmos
without weapons, without equipment for all future times.
In the end, I managed to influence their brave hearts.
They gave us excellent weapons, commonly called phasers,
destructive ray emitters, which surely everyone
in science fiction books knows as used by cosmic sailors,
small, resembling rifles, and also larger ones
like cannons or guns, as befitting
a ship traveling in vast distances in space.
They also gave us an artificial creature, cleverly designed
scientifically. But it took the form of a stinky skunk,
which learned people call Mephitis mephitis,
but common folks call it a stinker or a skunk.
It was a universal translator, knowing complex things in its mind,
able to speak many languages spoken by various beings
on many different planets in the twisted cosmos,
of which a million languages were known by this artificial creature.
They called him František, or simply Franta,
and he was almost entirely composed of those cells,
which are also found in the brains of humans,
but his trophic system was completely stunted,
so he only fed on small food pills.
That's why he could master a million languages.
They also gave us a robot named Tonda, who knew many complex things,
all technical knowledge, it was amazing to watch him,
to repair things for us if something went wrong
with many technical things on our ship.
Finally, they also gave us a doctor to accompany us,
to treat diseases and all other afflictions
of the crew. He had angered the rulers, so they sent him
as punishment with us into the boundless universe.
His name was Elefás, and everyone on earth called him Elefás,
both people and my good comrades.
They gave us a bad ship, not a good one,
but outdated and dangerous for star travel,
yet Tonda the robot repaired it as best he could,
but it was still bad and unreliable for the journey."
"The ship was named Tolma, and everyone called it Tolma,
men: Courage it truly was, to step onto that ship!
But when we had prepared many things already,
we boarded the well-polished ship with sighs in our hearts.
Immediately, the rocket propulsion drove our good ship,
and we soared into space, leaving Mother Earth behind.
From there, we sailed through the abysses of the empty cosmos,
searching for Mandys and the sheep that watches the universe."
