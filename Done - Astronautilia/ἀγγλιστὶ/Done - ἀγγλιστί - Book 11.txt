STARFLIGHTS SONG ELEVENTH
(On celibate men and what was related to it)

However, when we landed the swift ship, the starship, on the plain,
local men came to us with fejzrs in their hands,
they captured all the star navigators there with their armed power
in succession, my comrades and me, their captain,
5 they also placed difficult shackles on our sturdy hands,
led us to their city and to one of their rulers,
but the interpreter Franta walked beside me on his own.
The men wanted to strike him with the force of their fejzrs,
but a loud screech in their language addressed them,
10 the man, a carrier of fejzrs. Sacred horror seized them,
and then they let him walk behind us to the king's house.
They were experienced men and knowledgeable in technical matters,
but they lacked knowledge of languages, as well as other
matters that are usually called "humanities"
15 by the Latin term used by the men of the newer times on Earth.
Therefore, the interpreter Franta seemed to them like a wonder.
Thus we walked in shackles there to their mighty king.
We found him in the hall, seated on a radiant throne,
a great, handsome man and still quite young,
20 evidently strong and powerful, as it is generally fitting,
to be the ruler and king and shepherd of the other people.
When he saw us and heard the guards' report,
he addressed us in their local language, asking questions,
but the interpreter Franta translated all his words.
25 "Strangers, who are you? From where do you sail through the hollow cosmos?
Are you pursuing some goal, or are you just wandering aimlessly
like bandits across planets here and there,
risking your lives and causing troubles to strangers?"
So he spoke, to whom I replied in turn,
30 of course, in my own language, and the interpreter translated everything:
"No, ruler, we have not come now with evil intent
to this planet here, and we are not bandits either,
but guardians of a city that lies far from here,
we live on a planet called Earth,
35 distant and foreign; and through the vast cosmos
I have come to your land and to your bright planet,
where you reign, with your kind and with your swift ship.
For we are seeking a man, the fleeing thief.
Our rulers sent us and strictly commanded us
40 not to return home until we catch that thief,
nor was it a theft or robbery of some worthless thing,
but of something very precious, whose value is immeasurable.
I could not speak of it to other beings
who reside in the depths of the cosmos,
as they are mostly foolish about it."

45 However, on the contrary, ruler, and your noble men,
all of you are knowledgeable and have excellent minds.
Therefore, I will tell you about the troubles and dangers,
that he endangered both us and all of you here,
and also all things that exist in the depths of the cosmos.
50 Know, king, that Mandys, that uncatchable thief from us,
stole one sheep, which is not worthless at all,
but very valuable and its value is immeasurable.
There are supposedly certain equations in the science of physicists
wretched. Quantum ones supposedly explain the theory.
55 But the symbols of those very difficult equations
show that there must be a being that watches over the cosmos.
If there were no being constantly watching the universe,
the cosmos of distant journeys could no longer exist,
nor time, nor space, nor matter, nor anything else,
60 but something must always keep watch and gaze intently.
Who among mortal men could ever understand that?
Scholars have always speculated about the cosmic watch,
what kind of being it would be and a creature that watches over the universe,
but they found no solution in their pondering.
65 Finally, they came to the conclusion that this being is a sheep,
living on our Earth, which they diligently guarded.
But that man, Mandys, stole her, taking her into space,
endangering everyone here and he is the master of all things.
If the cunning Mandys were to kill the sheep,
70 nothing could endure among beings, as they are,
nor time, nor space, nor energy, nor matter.
Indeed, Mandys himself would perish along with everything,
but that man is a fool and he doesn't care about anything anymore.
Mandys could easily commit suicide in that way
75 with the entire cosmos itself. He would avenge all things with that.
Our rulers then sent us, the ones who rule on Earth,
to catch that Mandys and the sheep that watches over the universe.
But it happened secretly: They feared that the people would not find out.
We searched for Mandys here and there,
80 we sailed alone for a long time in the depths of the hollow cosmos,
we saw many strange things during the star journey,
amazing. I couldn't tell you all of them.
Finally, we caught Mandys and the sheep that watches over the universe
on one of the moons, where he used to be with the sheep,
85 but Mandys managed to escape again,
he caught the sheep himself and fled through space,
we pursued him wildly and were getting closer to him,
we wanted to catch him again and brave hearts were already rejoicing,
but your men ordered us to land,
90 and then they led us in shackles here to the city, then before you,
endangering us and the entire vast cosmos.
I wouldn't have told you about the sheep and that man
if it hadn't seemed necessary to us while we were in captivity."
Thus I spoke, and Franta translated everything.
95 The king and the others fell silent, sitting quietly.
But then the ruler ordered us to remove the shackles
from everyone's hands and invited us all to sit on chairs,
their servants also gave each of us
a cup or a goblet or a beautifully crafted chalice,
100 and poured red wine into them for us and the locals.
So now the hostile men became hospitable to us
those local men and their shepherd of people.

With us, they now drank and asked about everything,
about our affairs, our fates, when we journeyed through space,
105 but most of all about the sheep that watches over the universe.
We gladly listed these things in response to them,
but Franta, the interpreter, translated all their words,
and finally, the king himself spoke words to us:
"You speak of amazing things, stranger, about the divine sheep,
110 which watches over the universe, and about Mandys, the fugitive of the stars.
I recognize and also know that everyone is endangered by this,
the entire vast cosmos and all beings and stars,
both time and space, as well as energy and matter,
so it is a strong necessity to catch him as quickly as possible.
115 I will help you with that, and all my comrades
will help catch that Mandys and the sheep that watches over the universe,
and to quickly return with him to Earth to your homeland,
for I certainly would not want to become the guardian of that sheep,
nor any of ours here, for it is truly a great task,
120 but we will give our assistance and provide as much as I can,
all the people here and also the spacecraft,
so that you catch Mandys, who carries the sheep, along with the sheep."
So spoke the royal man, and all applauded the ruler,
and I myself gave thanks with a resounding word.
125 This understanding we celebrated with a feast in the hall,
locals and astronauts, and we drank wine strongly.
But when they got drunk and became heavy with wine,
all the local men and my good comrades,
—I myself am not a great drinker and only drink moderately—
130 the local men began to shout at the servants
to bring them something that Franta couldn't translate.
The servants then brought strange things like skins,
and distributed them among the feasters, one for each.


They also gave me one of those things, and my heart marveled at it.
135 But the locals began to inflate those skins
with their mouths, then the limbs of women began to appear,
breasts and buttocks as well as hidden instruments of love,
and it was shown that these figures of girls
were made from some material and cleverly crafted.
140 When they had them inflated and the inflation pipes plugged,
the local men began to fornicate with the cleverly constructed figures,
which was a strange sight to behold.
A sacred power of the king ruled over them in this.
But these maidens, whose knowledge was given by technology,
145 did not lie quietly as befits dead forms,
but cooperated with all the fornicating men
as if they were alive, it was a miracle of technical science.
Seeing this, my good comrades also
began to inflate figures of women themselves,
150 and then to mix their limbs with the fabricated women.
But I do not wish to say anything more about myself,
what else happened in that hall, for I am ashamed to speak of it.
In the end, the local men and all my comrades
were exhausted by these activities, and sleep covered their heads.
155 Thus, exhausted, we lay in the banquet hall overnight until the clear dawn,
the king, the people, and we guests alike.
When dawn with its rose-colored fingers appeared,
(strange, entirely different from what we have on Earth),
that's when I woke up inside the king's house
160 but the others were still deeply asleep.

And there I saw the king, sitting upright on his throne,
and my courageous heart immediately prompted me to ask him.
I immediately woke up Franta and brought him into the light from his sleep,
and then I addressed the king himself with my words
165 (but the interpreter Franta translated all my words):
"Strange, O king, I saw something peculiar and extraordinary
in this hall of yours yesterday, that they fornicated with women here
with artificial robot women, it was a strange sight.
And so far, I haven't seen with my own eyes
170 any local women here, whether wives or maidens,
because with them there would surely be better erotic acts.
But tell me, O king, kindly reveal the mystery to me
about those artificial maidens and why they are not natural."
So I spoke, and the chief of men replied
175 (but the interpreter Franta translated all his words).
"To you, stranger, I will now explain everything in order.
Long ago, in ancient times now lost to memory,
there were on our earth, as is common and normal,
men and also women, as is usual
180 among gonochoristic beings in the vast cosmos.
But long ago, a great ship landed on our land
from the sky, and from it emerged women of a wicked kind,
lesbians, lovers of women, and of very wild minds.
Overall, they looked just like ordinary women,
185 but they had tails and also large ears
pointed like those of animals, but otherwise they were human-like.
They had higher and better technology than we had
at that time when they landed on our soil,
so they easily established a lesbian dictatorship here.
190 Most of the men they cruelly killed with their weapons,
but they left a few to toil in the worst tasks,
and as they did not know the technique yet
to fertilize one egg with the nucleus of another egg
as it is possible to do; this technique was unknown to these women.
195 But from the normal women, they chose their companions.


And so tyranny ruled over our land for a long time.
But once men improved their technological knowledge
(secretly, because slaves were not allowed to train in sciences),
then they quickly brought destruction upon the lesbian women,
200 achieving victory in the rebellion, which succeeded well for the men.
All the tail-bearing women were killed by the men,
but the normal women became their slaves,
because a great fear of the tyrannical women gripped them.
And then, gradually, they became like mute animals
205 through the genetic technique, our knowledge.
We created giant women to carry burdens
and also for the pleasure of men's buttocks.
They bore burdens for us and toiled like draft animals,
and they also gave birth to children, boys and girls.
210 Among these offspring, males were always like other men,
but the female offspring were like mute animals.
So we lived, and we had no fear of women,
because they were now foolish and tame like animals.
But then some disease came upon our beasts of burden,
215 which was unknown to us, so we could not heal them.
They all perished, and there are no more women left,
to bear burdens for us or to give birth to children,
nor do we have the knowledge to create them with technical skill.
A lethal mutation arose in our species,
220 on the X chromosome, so that when it is doubled,
the female being cannot live, thus created.
Nor do we have the power to remove this affliction in any other way,
but without offspring, certain destruction awaits us.
We made inflatable women for sinful purposes."
225 So spoke the royal man, and Franta translated everything.
But now I addressed him with my own words.
"Listen, king, to what I will now tell you.
I think I can solve your life's problem now,
if you will listen to my words and heed them as well.
230 When we traveled through the stars in the depths of space
(searching for Mandys and the sheep that watches the cosmos),
we came to a planet inhabited by tail-bearing women,
as well as maidens with long ears.
I now believe that this planet,
235 from which those who landed on your land came,
was inhabited by these tail-bearing women,
lesbians, lovers of women, and of very wild minds.
But the queen of that planet told me
(I was her lover, and now I boast of it)
240 everything about that planet, its wars, and its cosmic travels.
A certain maiden rose up and began to proclaim rebellion,
to overthrow men and let women rule over them,
gradually changing the minds of all those women,
until they started the rebellion and also won it.
245 Those who emerged victorious in that land were of two kinds:
firstly, lesbians who harbored hatred towards all men,
and lovers of men who still wanted to rule over them.
There were other normal men and women there too,
who wanted to live as they did before and have men rule.
250 They allowed the normal ones to sail away on black ships,
but the rulers of men divided themselves once again,
namely into lesbians and ruling lovers of men.
Now these maidens in long robes cast lots,
and the lesbians were chosen to leave the planet.
255 These were probably the ones who landed on your planet,
and then the others gathered, just as you have told me now.
But those who remained on the planet, the tail-bearing women,
ruled over the broken men as their hearts prompted,
until gradually the men themselves became mutants,
260 and they were now foolish and quadrupedal, like animals.
They rejoiced in being ruled by false bitches,
whom they also called "bitches" by name.
But much of their technology and rare knowledge was lost to them.
They surely did not lack reason, like women,
265 but the ability and skill from which various mechanical things arise
according to sciences and other male works.
So their knowledge of how to travel through the universe
and other technologies that they previously had on their planet disappeared.
And we arrived on that planet during our journey through the stars.
270 I would not want to tell you everything about that planet,
all the dangers and sufferings we endured there as men,
but I will tell you one thing, and you should keep it in mind:
that the tail-bearing women do not want to rule over men anymore,
but on the contrary, they want to submit to men,
275 just as it was the natural order for women before.
Liars have now become repulsive and odious to them,
but they now desire normal men, as is proper.
If you now step onto the planet of the tail-bearing girls
with your companions, you will quickly resolve the bitter problems
280 of the girls, as well as the men and even yourself.
But now prepare your swift ships and your companions,
sail to these girls, and I will show you the way."
So I spoke, and the king rejoiced in his courageous heart.
Immediately jumping up from his seat, he seized the radio
285 with his mighty hand and called all his companions.
They began to prepare for what was necessary for the starry journey.
But when dawn broke and the rose-fingered dawn appeared
(strange and different from ours, not resembling it at all),
the ships of the native men took off from the populous planet,
290 and I and my good companions
took flight into space on Tolma, the black ship,
and I, taking hold of the helm, showed them all the way.
There were ten ships from these men of the cosmic ships,
but the eleventh one, that was our little ship.
295 For twenty days we sailed through the earthly depths of space,
but on the twentieth day, the planet of the women appeared.
Descending onto the plain, we landed our good ships and delayed,
quickly setting foot on the planet,
and then we set out on foot to the city of the tail-bearing women,
300 not without weapons, for experience had taught us.
All of us had flawless weapons hidden in our pockets,
which science fiction writers call "phasers."
