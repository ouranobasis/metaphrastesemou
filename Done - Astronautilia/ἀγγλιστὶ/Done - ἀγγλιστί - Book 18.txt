STARFLOATING CANTO EIGHTEEN
(Of Grogal's temple and its guardians. The prominence of Burda.
Of the parrot centaurs)
Thus we sailed there through the abysses of empty space
toward the butterfly star and the moon of Grogal the seer,
to ask where the sheep and Mandys could be make it.
But when we came to the planet again, as I already described
5 in my bound speech up there, in the eighth canto,
then I steered the swift boat to the moon,
one of the four moons, which was the only one of all that had air, 
and where Grogalos the seer was hidden in the icy slush.
On this month we also came to where he was hiding,
10 creatures of the Grogals the prophet the one frozen in the vaulted slush.
We set out to look for the prophet there, the frozen man,
the way is already good a familiar one, which we had all passed once before.
However, when we came to the place where that cave was,
then we were kind of startled and stood looking.
15 For in that place now stood a great pyramid,
built perhaps out of ice there hard, very cold, 
but far away from her the city towered high.
However, I took the binoculars out of my pockets,
I aimed it at the city and looked at everything in it.
20 There were beings in that city, very special indeed, 
they did not resemble any of the earth animals at all,
so it is very difficult to describe them with just words.
They were on four legs, but they also had hands,
or some kind of buckles and on their heads they had beaks
25 like parrots, and antennae like beetles .
It seemed to these Grogals that they were serving beings
as their slaves, both straight and four-legged.
But it seemed to us that they had technology in the city,
automatic vehicles and other similar things,
30 and now the situation seemed to us all to be obvious.
Strange beings colonized these moons
just like the Grogali used to (however, I didn't know the reason),
but the Grogali were all slaves to them.
They apparently took them from the planet, just like the men once
35 white people in ancient times they did with the black men.
But on the contrary, it seemed that the soothsayers were bowing to the frozen one
and that now the pyramid was made for him in the manner of a temple.
Thus it seemed difficult to ask the soothsayers now,
and our long journey also seemed in vain.
40 However, I still wanted to know if they had him inside, 
into the ice frozen there, a furry, great seer. 
I entered the pyramid. None of those creatures seemed to be
anywhere nearby, and the place seemed empty,
so I entered the door and my comrades followed me.
45 But when I and my comrades entered,
Immediately he arose from somewhere and the guard rushed at me, 
strange and exotic and surprisingly it was an animal, 
but this animal had no fixed shape, 
but it kept changing as an amoeba does, 
50 and it was also transparent and shone like a flame. 
It rushed at us with a jump and it fell on one man, 
it began to suck the life out of him, so at least it seemed to us, 
for the creature created a kind of transparent burrow, 
it pierced our comrade and killed him, as we imagined. 
55 Immediately after that, a larger became and also shone more powerfully.
Then we shot at him with deadly feyzers from a distance,
however, the furious creature remained completely unharmed,
on the contrary, the monster grew bigger after each blow.
Then he sped off again and killed the star wolf,
60 but we trembled on our glorious limbs in fear.
Suddenly, the technician Burda let out a mighty yelp
and did something quickly with his personal phaser,
after aiming well at the creature, the phaser he pulled the trigger. 
Immediately, the big animal was sucked into the fejzer by force
65 and it was gone. And Burda boasted with the words: 
"Truly, it's not a bad thing if a person knows technology, 
as I know it and I killed a terrible monster, 
for it was not made of matter - but of mere energy, 
and when he hit it fejzr, it just gained more strength.
70 The newest creature lost like this could not be a weapon.
But I, because I am smart, reversed the fezr's poles,
and so I sent the energy back into the fezr inside.
This would be the captain himself, not the ship's a learned doctor, 
nor the translator of all the languages ​​that exist in the cosmos
75 would not be able to do it. Great technology is the glory!" 
That's what the man Burda said and everyone laughed at him, 
but not for long, because the other one was killed by an animal. 
Then with the help of fejzers, and abundant tears 
we turned them into nothingness there - because for the funeral the time was not right,
80 but then we went on looking for Grogal frozen in the ice.
Then we saw him in the middle of the temple, huge,
inside the altar of ice, how he is completely frozen in it,
transparent, clear and bright, just like if he was made of glass, 
two energy animals were always watching over him.
85 Then our human Burda stuck his face in there.
But now we wanted to ask the hidden seer
we gave him electrodes, as before, on both temples,
 but in the altar now he was frozen solid inside.
But on the altar we saw with our own eyes,
90 in strange letters that there was some kind of inscription.
However, the interpreter Franta translated it for us, read it easily,
and according to the inscription he told us the famous Grogala name. 
His name was Onufrius, and because he was a hairy man,
but that Grogal showed great learning.
95 For on our Earth in ancient, bygone times
there was a saint Onufrius, who lived like a hermit in the desert
and there on He was in that desert for such a long time,
that he became hairy and equal to a large animal,
so from the saint again, Pafnuce said, when he came to him,
100 a reasonable person could hardly be recognized anymore.
From that for these things, apparently took Grogalos name.
But the interpreter Franta told us all those things.
Only that his learning was of no use to us now
as the technician Burda scolded him for it.
105 We wanted to dig up the ice altar by hand,
 but as close as we were to the altar in the middle of the temple, 
a very distressing voice of alarm began to shriek there, 
numerous lights also began to blink inside the temple.
So we broke the altar with our fejzers, 
110 grabbing Grogal, we quickly went to the ship they carried him. 
The four-legged monsters rushed quickly to the temple
there being a large number there in their cars
with terrible alarm sounds, just like on our Earth
male firemen have it in their cars.
115 Then we ran quickly there the plains of that moon,
we carried the great Grogal the man very easily,
because there on the moon the gravity was less,
capable of holding the air,but again for earthly men
favorable for their running and/or jumping.
120 But no one seemed to be waiting for the runners,
because the quadrupeds were being carried in cars.
A kind of Grogalian dog came up barking loudly,
and wanting to kill him, I aimed my feyzer at him ,
but before I pulled the trigger, I changed my mind on the matter,
125 but I hit him in the head with his hard pickaxe,
dead I easily carried Grogal in my hand
light, for gravity there is less power than the moon.
But the quadrupeds were already on our heels, so to speak,
and then they started shooting at us with deadly phasers.
130 Then the whole crew would have perished there on the ship,
if it hadn't been for Burdy, who knew many things in his mind.
From the hideous interpreter, who he carried, took out a bomb,
he already called a tear gas, and threw it on the quadruped.
Immediately gloomy smoke began to blow from the bomb,
135 making a screen for us and they coughed again
terrible that they could no longer drive their vehicles behind us.
 This is how we fled from them with the prophet and the dead dog, 
hairy both of us — (this will be a very serious matter).
We quickly entered the ship and drove it up, the starship, 
140 immediately the rocket propulsion propelled the vessel into space, 
We flew up into space and left the moon alien.
However, the quadrupeds found us in their ship,
and then they also started chasing us in the depths of space.
And they already started to catch up with us and fire 
145 feyzers from their cannons; our vessel was shaking terribly. 
We shot back at them again with a phaser cannon, 
but the refugees did not seem to have any hope, 
after all, many had ships and we only had one. 
Then the entire crew would have perished on the ship 
150 of our s the whole ship and of course with all the species, 
if I hadn't devised a great ruse for them then.
I took the dead dog in my strong hands,
I strapped a rocket crate to the back of this corpse,
and then I sent him flying out of the running ship ,
155 Hairy Grogal there through the chasms of the empty cosmos.
Those four-legged and beaked alien beings,
as soon as they saw the hairy Grogal flying there through the void
back, they immediately thought that the holy Grogalos was the prophet.
Immediately they all set off after him with their ships. 
160 However, we, having increased our speed, fled from their reach.
It also occurred to me that, of course, in the ship we now have a
space pirate machine, which they always have in ships,
the electromagnetic shield of the vessels.
If someone would blast the ship around the screen, 
165 the ship will become invisible and inaudible to 
sensors of other ships; that Burda now installed.
Immediately the ship was invisible and inaudible
and those strange beings could no longer recognize it.
Further then we sailed there through the abysses of the empty cosmos,
170 narrowly escaping death and having Grogal the seer.

dead I easily carried the Grogal in my hand
light, because of gravity there is less strength than the moon.
But already the four-leggeds were on our heels, so to speak,
and then they started shooting at us with deadly feyzers.
130 Then the whole crew would be the ship perished there, 
if it hadn't been for Burdy, who knew many things in his mind.
From the hideous interpreter he was carrying, he pulled out a bomb,
which he already calls a tear gas, and threw it at the quadruped.
Immediately, gloomy smoke began to billow from the bomb,
135 he makes a screen for us and the cough made them feel
terrible that they could no longer drive their vehicles behind us.
This is how we fled from them with the prophet and the dead dog,
hairy both of us — (this will be a very serious matter).
Quickly we entered the ship and drove it up, the starship, 
140 immediately the rocket drive propelled the vessel into space, 
up we flew into space and left the moon as a stranger. 
However, the quadrupeds found us here in their ship, 
and then they also started chasing us in in the depths of the cosmos. 
And they already started to catch up with us and fire
