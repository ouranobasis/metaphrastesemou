STARFLIGHTS SONG SIXTH
(On the double planet and other matters)
We arrived at the planet during our starry voyage
(Seeking Mandys and the sheep that the universe follows),
foreign and strange, peculiar at first sight.
It was double, connected there like a pair
5 which skilled men once trained together
in ancient, wooden times: For they were two planets
connected by a massive pillar and immense, in a single pair.
As we approached them, they seemed like a pair
shining in the black darkness there amidst the empty cosmos,
10 slowly revolving. Then, behold, my heart urged me
to land on this planet and find out what it was.
Immediately, I turned all the sensors towards this planet,
to see if there was air and water, as well as warmth,
like on our Earth. And the sensors confirmed it.
15 So I steered our ship towards this planet.
But when we landed on the plain, descending from the sky
and stood below, having stayed down,
I now chose two of the best companions,
adding a third robot for security reasons
20 (not without caution, for experience had taught us),
and sent them to go into the land and look, to find out,
what kind of beings were on the planet, eaters of food,
whether they were wild and arrogant, even malicious,
or whether they were friendly and had a kind mind.
25 Quickly, they saw a strange city,
but did not enter it, returning promptly,
and then they reported to me something incredibly strange:
There were no humanoid creatures in the city,
but some kind of dogs, with human intelligence.

30 But as they spoke, the dogs approached the ship
in great numbers, also carrying various weapons
of malicious appearance. Then our hearts were filled with dread.
For there were countless of them, bearing weapons
similar to our own fejzrs. They could easily
35 have killed all of us and our black ship itself.
There was no time left for us to retreat to a safe ship
in the cosmic void, for the dogs were very close.
Lamenting, we tried to pray,
if perhaps a god might be alive in the depths of the cosmos,
40 but no opportunity appeared for the praying.
The dogs then approached closer and waved their fejzrs at us.
So we fled inside our black ship now,
taking cover in its well-made armor,
and prepared the fejzr cannon for firing.
45 However, there was no hope, for they were very numerous.
We saw them on the television now, rushing towards us
in great fear, with despair seizing our minds.
Suddenly we saw them, turning back again,
and that they were firing at them, and they at another army there.
50 We saw warriors fighting with dogs now,
similar to earthly cats, a great spectacle to behold.
These dogs and cats showed great rage towards each other,
all firing at each other with their formidable fejzrs.
Many from both sides had already disappeared from the fight.
55 We, having regained our senses, watched the fierce battle intently.
Suddenly, beneath our feet, the black ship split open
and we fell inside, fear gripping our hearts.
But as it descended, the ship flew up and down
like a pendulum, as it is on old clocks,
60 bouncing rapidly over a great distance in the void,
terrifyingly careening back and forth — our hearts were filled with dread.
Finally, the good ship calmed down with a slow pace,
and we saw a strange theater on the television.
The planet was hollow, and very large and wide,
65 a gigantic sphere, and hollow, a massive structure,
but our ship hung in the middle of it.
There was no gravity force inside the planet,
only on its surface, but inside there was none,
for the gravity force pulled in all directions
70 and thus canceled itself completely.


There was no darkness here either, as many lamps shone brightly, spreading light as if it were daytime. We saw many strange things flying inside. Suddenly, opposite the ship, there hurried a group of living beings resembling mortal men, but they flew like birds in space. Each of them had some kind of bagpipes on their shoulders, and each inflated the bellows with their mouth or by blowing into the pipes, then pressed the bellows with their hands. The pipes themselves sounded like they were playing, propelling them forward—
80 but they made no sound like Earthly bagpipes do; these instruments only made a faint sound as they were played quietly. From this, it was clear to us that there was air inside as well. They squeezed the bagpipes and quickly flew to the ship, indicating by gestures that they wanted to be friendly to the strangers. We, trying, unlocked the good ship, but we did not let go of our fejzrs,
85 the swift destroyers of men, for experience had taught us. The pipe-carrying men entered the black ship, and when they had arrived inside, they all stood in the air with us; for there was no gravity force inside either. They greeted us politely in their land, but the interpreter Franta translated their speech for us all. As they spoke, we looked at them in amazement.
95 They resembled men born on Earth,
but longer and weaker than all on Earth,
with very long and slender limbs, resembling spiders,
for in weightlessness, strength is not needed. Then some kind of leader spoke winged words:
"Citizens who are just here and from the depths of the cosmos,
100 now you are very fortunate, as you have narrowly escaped ruin,
to fejzrs, bearers of sorrow and destruction, to swift dogs,
and also to cats. They now fight each other there,
but we have pulled your ship to be inside.
Now life has become sweet for you inside, as it has for us.
105 Cats and dogs are now fighting outside.
Do you ask about the causes and essence of all these things?
It is difficult and also long to tell all these things,
the best would be to explain them at a splendid feast.
Rise, strangers, and let's go to the city and the ruler's house;
110 he wishes to see you and also to entertain you.
We have brought you bagpipes that cause quick movement,
and it is not very difficult to learn what to do with them,
and then let us go to the ruler to join the splendid feast."
Thus he spoke, and he convinced our hearts kindly.


They gave everyone bagpipes so they could fly to the city and the house. So we went there flying, curiosity holding our minds, not without weapons, for experience had taught us. We all had excellent weapons hidden in our pockets, which science fiction writers call fejzrs in their writings. But we saw the ruler's house hanging in the air; it was very excellent and more splendid than any other. We entered the house swiftly, like wasps entering their nest, aided by the swift flight of the bagpipes, and there in the grand hall, the ruler was seated on his silver throne, which they had attached to the floor. But when we paid the ruler the customary respect, the king himself addressed us again with winged words, asking about all things, and we told him everything—Franta the interpreter translated their speech for us all—there is certainly no need to state everything here. And after many speeches, they led us into a large hall, clinging to the pipes that stretched everywhere along the ceiling—this was the way of movement in weightlessness. Then they seated us on benches fastened to the ground, gave us food and drink to enjoy like feasts, in closed vessels so that the contents would not fly upwards, we took the food with forks and the drink with straws, and the local men also participated in the feast. But when we had taken food and drink as much as we desired, the king and the noble men began to ask again who we were and other various things, and then I told them everything in order, as it should be told, and the interpreter translated the words. And now I also asked the king about the two hollow planets connected here, which rotate, and also about the cats and dogs and the men inside the planet. But the ruler spoke to me in winged words: "Stranger, you now ask about the two hollow planets and about the great, bloody battle between cats and dogs, about our dwelling inside the hollow planet. I will tell you now, but it will be a long story. However, you must also know about these things so that you can help us; so now I will tell you everything. We were two tribes of people and lived together on a completely different planet, and we were enemies, constantly fighting together for many centuries. We had higher technology and science than we have now in the present time, for we have forgotten much in the difficult wars with the cats and also with the dogs. But our ancestors knew many techniques.


On the first planet, they first fought constantly with various weapons for many centuries, gradually with increasingly dreadful weapons throughout all time, until the atomic bomb was born in their minds. By shooting it, they ruined the entire planet, so that nothing living could endure on it anymore, neither people, nor animals, nor birds, nor plants. But our ancestors knew many complex, wondrous techniques that we, sons, do not know now. They quickly made peace and also concluded a permanent treaty, binding themselves with many promises and a beautiful oath. Then they all flew into space on great ships of enormous construction, for they knew complex technology. They found a suitable solar system in the depths of space, around which they created two artificial planets with a technique now hidden from us, for we have forgotten it again, from some strange substance, which is indeed harder than all known substances and harder than diamonds, which are the hardest substances of all known to us, arranged in the Mendeleev system. The substance of these planets was harder than all these. Our ancestors then made these two planets hollow to avoid disputes over land among mortal people who would dwell there, but the force of gravity was to be the same as on the star from which they came. And when they created them, they began to live on them, each nation choosing one planet, but they were connected together by a huge column, a symbol of their friendship. This was a huge, perfect work. The planets connected in this way were named CONCORD. At first, they all loved each other, but later they began to show jealousy towards each other, for old and normal to them was war. Then the rulers introduced them to deceptive warfare, like the clash of dogs and cats instead of people. They tried to quench their thirst for war this way. One sent dogs and the other cats to war against each other, instead of people. Thus, they played war with each other. At first, the matter seemed reasonable and quite nice, but, like everything else, people spoiled it again. The smarter men bred war animals, both cats and dogs, until they were as clever as humans, so they devised various cunning war tactics. They also bred them to be as combative as possible, arming them with bitter weapons, carriers of death. This way, the game turned into a true total war, and people, dogs, and cats alike were unable to refrain from battle, and each faced dire times.

In the end, cats and dogs, along with us, also entered the war, often emerging victorious because they were more adept at fighting than us, so eventually people fled into the depths of the planets. And now we live here, and we also have everything we need through technology to sustain life, air, light, water, and everything else, fruits, vegetables, sheep, and slow cows, everything that is necessary for humans to lead their lives. But inside the planet, there is no gravity force, so we are taller and more delicate than our ancestors or you, earthly creatures, both animals and humans. Truly, we no longer have any strength or robustness in our limbs to walk outside on the star, from which we came, or even any firmness, but we live here inside and have a beautiful life, while outside cats and dogs fiercely fight each other."

So spoke the royal man, and it seemed strange to us. But when the servants poured us a new drink, the king's sacred power took hold of his words again:

"If the swift dogs did not fight with the cats, they could easily attack us inside the planets, but as long as they remain at war with each other, they have no reason or time to also wage war with us. However, if the dogs and cats were to unite in peace, a war would quickly threaten us. Now the danger is great for those who are inside. A certain dog has emerged among the belligerent dogs, intelligent and wise, and he is like a prophet to them. All the other dogs call him Hau-bau-vau, but mortal people call him Démogeront. (That's how the translator translated that name from dog language, but it sounded different in the language of the inner men.) This one supposedly daily announces the will of the gods to them, urging them to make peace, to conclude treaties, to unite, and then to dig their way to the surface, even if it is hard, to attack us inside and kill some of us, but also to enslave others, so that we have to serve domestic animals as before. Now they want to rule over humans. We are rich here, for we have plenty of food and drink, but they have destroyed everything up there with constant war. However, if there were an invasion, we would have no chance, for they are more numerous and much better in battle. The only advice we have now is to kill Démogeront and prevent the animals from uniting. But we don't have the strength to emerge from the holes and walk normally on the hard planets. We have lived in weightlessness for so long that strength, robustness, and masculinity have disappeared from our limbs and minds. But cats and dogs now have complicated plans. They have conceived the idea of holding a plenary meeting. And Démogeront intends to address them both. If anyone could kill him at that congress, the union of cats and dogs could surely not occur. But someone must go out and kill the dog prophet, some of you foreign men, for it is no longer possible for us. If anyone goes out and kills the dog prophet—there are many precious treasures in our houses—silver, gold, and what people call platinum—many treasures I will give to him and his other kind, I will make everyone rich, and I will not envy them anything, for there is nothing more precious and better than life."

So he spoke, and we all fell silent, sitting quietly. It was a huge and terrible deed, above all others, but we were also spurred on by the wealth, the creators of men.

In the end, a complex thought emerged in my mind:

That we would stay here in the underground houses of men and send out the robot soldier Ivo to the surface, the destroyer of men and carrier of various weapons (that robot was of the type that men call ROBOKOP). And he would save all degenerates on the planet. This robot's name was Ivo, as he was entirely made of iron. I told this to the king, and he rejoiced in his heart. He invited us to stay there until all the animals gathered in his noble house and to enjoy food and drink. They also entertained themselves differently because the men inside the planet always love various kinds of entertainment. They always love the guitar, song, and dance, drugs that bring bliss, and the work of the goddess from Cyprus in a group, not secretly, as was the custom of the hippie men who once lived on Earth in the ancient and archaic age, the "twentieth century," which is commonly referred to by that name. These hippies seemed similar to the underground men in their habits, and there were beautiful women there, slim and tall, also favorable to us sailors. However, many common practices could be shared in weightlessness. I won't say everything about the famous works of Cyprus, for now, I feel very ashamed. So we rejoiced and waited for the congress of animals. Cats inhabited the second of the two connected planets, while swift dogs resided on our planet. These two planets were connected by a huge column, incredibly long, with a length of forty-five thousand and five hundred, but then another thousand and a half, and add another hundred and twenty kilometers, so the length of the column was as long as the distance from the Moon to the Earth. These planets were connected by such a beam, rotating in wonder to the delight of astronomers. Inside this column, there were also elevators, beautiful and built there by the minds very familiar to the ancestors of today's men. It was an intricate and splendid technology. I don't want to tell you everything about this technology; surely it's a difficult and long story to narrate. These elevators were fast, not slow, traveling at a speed of one hundred and eighty kilometers per hour – it took just one hour to travel from one planet to the other, a journey that would take a month on Earth. The cats traveled down among the swift dogs on these elevators.




So we eagerly awaited the congress of animals. But when they assembled and were already gathered, both cats and dogs began to negotiate in council (we had sensors there that informed us of everything). At that moment, I sent robot Ivo to the surface of the planet to kill the prophet Demogernot with his deadly phasers. He flew like a bird all the way to the surface of the artificial star, clutching his bagpipes for flight, as there was no gravity force. However, as soon as the machine opened the exit to the planet, it fell back inside because the force of gravity took hold of it, which made the other creatures laugh. The men living inside then gave him a large ladder. Eventually, he climbed outside and made his way to the congress. But we remained inside, watching everything diligently with our sensors—those futuristic video cameras.

Cats and dogs all gathered in a large hall, resembling an amphitheater, with all of them being as clever as humans. Then a big, very hairy dog, Demogern, began to speak with a booming voice, which was amplified (the interpreter translated everything for us listeners). But I won't repeat everything he said, as it would bore everyone. Demogern began to tell them tales of peace, as well as stories of unity between all dogs and cats, claiming that both are still predatory animals of the same order, even if they belong to different families. However, neither cats nor dogs listened to him. The fast dogs immediately called him a traitor, while the cats named him an enemy of the cat breed. They all attacked him, killing and tearing him apart, and then they began to fight each other fiercely, using their deadly phasers. Those hit immediately turned transparent, disappearing like mist, and then there were no more animals. It was a great battle and very favorable to the locals, as many animals had gathered there. Many dogs and cats perished, those who had come for the peace meeting.

So nature is always stronger than reason. I happily called the robot back inside. But the king gave us many treasures, as promised, although they had destroyed themselves. Now I wanted to continue traveling through boundless space, as I had a duty to my good companions. But they seemed to prefer staying inside with the locals, enjoying various drugs and engaging in erotic acts in groups in the weightless state, which allowed for many ways, without working at all. It seemed like paradise to them. But at the same time, I cleverly concocted a deception against their leaders. I got my good companions drunk on euphoric drugs, then I secretly brought them into the ship while they were asleep, without their consent. Then I activated the robot helmsman and ordered him to quickly fly into space. However, the local men uncovered a hole in the hull. Immediately, the rocket propulsion propelled our good ship, and we soared into space, leaving the planet behind.

From there, we sailed through the abysses of empty space, searching for Mandy, the sheep that roams the universe.
