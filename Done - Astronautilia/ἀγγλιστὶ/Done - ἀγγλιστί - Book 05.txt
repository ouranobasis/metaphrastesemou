STARFLIGHTS SONG FIFTH
(About degenerates)

We then arrived on a planet during our stellar journey
(Seeking Mandyse and the sheep that follows the universe),
where beings lived that were peculiar to behold,
similar in external form to earthly humans,
5 but inside, they were entirely different.
However, when we landed our good ship on solid ground,
descended from the sky and landed upon it,
many local men immediately came out to meet us,
wishing to see both us and our ship.
10 However, the local men did not wish to bring us harm,
seeming hospitable to us strangers,
greeting us with courteous words in their language,
(Franta the translator translated their speech for us),
kindly leading us to their magnificent city,
15 to their beloved king and directly to his house.
We walked to their city with these local men,
not without weapons, for experience had taught us:
We all had excellent weapons concealed in our pockets,
which science fiction writers call "phasers."
20 They led us to a magnificent hall, shining with brilliance,
in which their king, Rx-Frx-Prx, the hero, sat
on his silver throne, surrounded by many courtiers,
men as well as women. He sat, proud of his glory.
This Rx-Frx-Prx, the king, then addressed us in their language
25 (Franta the translator translated his speech for us).
"Strangers, who are you? Whence do you sail through empty space?
Are you pursuing some goal, or are you just wandering aimlessly,
like pirates across planets here and there,
setting your lives and bringing suffering to strangers?"
30 Thus he spoke. To him I then spoke in reply:
"Indeed, O king, we are not lawless pirates,
but guardians of a city far from here
on a planet foreign to you, called Earth by name.
We have come to your town and to this planet of yours
35 in search of a wicked thief who is fleeing.
Our rulers have sent us and strictly commanded me
not to return home until we capture the thief.
We sail around all planets that have air
and conditions similar to those on our Earth,
40 unfortunate as we are. Truly it would be better
and much more appropriate and easier
to search for a well-sewn needle
in a haystack that brings joy to horses.
But even then, no chance appears to the unfortunate.
Now we have entered your planet with sighs in our hearts,
45 chasing that thief through the depths of emptiness,
for here you have air and water and warm sun,
just like on our Earth, and we wanted to rest
from the life of starfarers, in which there is no strength.
O ruler Rx-Frx-Prx, have mercy, be hospitable
50 to us poor men. We have the honor to ask you."

We entered the bathhouse and the pool with warm water,
naked, as is proper, leaving all our clothes
outside on the benches, and ourselves into the warm bath
we entered, swimming here and there with pleasant thoughts.
But the bath attendants looked as if they were fools.
Still, even this gave us no hint of trouble,
for bath attendants are often fond of men.
Suddenly, however, one of them ran off and returned
with two other men who had the appearance of doctors.
These two, also standing by the edge of the pleasant bath,
looked at us there and spoke to each other.
But we could not understand what they were saying,
because I left Franta outside with our clothes.
He was created to be as odorous as a skunk,
which naturalists call Mephitis mephitis,
but common folk call it a stink bomb or skunk.
Franta resembled that, and he had no love for bathing.
But those two men who stood by the pool's edge
now addressed the men who were swimming, in strange voices.
Immediately, I sent one of our companions to the front hall
to bring Franta, our translator of all languages.
He then swiftly ran there and returned,
bringing Franta in his hand, and then placed him on the edge.
But as I swam to that shore,
the foreign doctor addressed me with his words
(Franta, the all-translator, translated his speech entirely):
"Greetings, foreign father, you, captain, and the others.
We two are the physicians of the illustrious Rx-Frx-Prx,
and the ruler and chief of the people Rx-Frx-Prx himself
has ordered us to examine you, to see if all of you
have come to the city and his house unharmed
and also in good health.
For I say that there is truly nothing worse
than to weaken a man in the empty cosmos.
But you and your companions must now step out of the pool onto the shore,
so that we may determine your physical condition, and examine you,
myself and my colleague, as the king commanded us."

So he spoke, and Franta the translator translated his speech entirely
with a rather loud voice, and everyone heard his words.
From there, all the others quickly stepped out of the bath onto the shore,
my companions, as well as I, and listened to the two doctors.
However, one of the doctors, who treated on our ship,
spoke harshly with his black, bitter mind,
demanding immediate destruction for both doctors,
as they humiliated him as a doctor of famous abilities,
wanting to examine and evaluate our health themselves.
He yelled loudly, but I ordered Franta
not to translate any of that for the two medical men,
and quickly calmed his mind with kind words.
Those two men then examined us in a proper manner,
each one of us, including me and the ship's doctor.
They spoke to each other in winged words and many
but not in the language spoken by everyone on this planet,
for they had an ancient and peculiar language,
a secret one spoken only by scholars among themselves,
similar to how Latin was once spoken on Earth—
but Franta the translator translated it all nevertheless,
secretly, with a soft voice, as I had ordered him.
"Truly, the construction of these foreign men is not bad,
for they are tall and robust, as is proper,
with strong thighs, calves, and powerful upper arms,
a straight back and neck, and also broad shoulders—
a pleasure indeed to behold them.
Their faces are also well-formed, with noses and mouths,
both eyes and ears, and each one is truly handsome.
They all have five fingers on each hand, as well as feet,
well-formed men and no androgynes.
We must improve our offspring using them,
for surely God himself sent them down from heaven."
So they alternated speaking in winged words, both
in that ancient language unknown to any of the common men
on this planet, except for the wise,
but Franta the translator translated it all nevertheless.
As for me, when I heard this, my heart was deeply troubled,
for it seemed they wanted to detain us on their planet
as their prisoners and admit their women to us,
so that the race would improve and better children would be born.
Franta translated all of this secretly to me
with a muted voice, as I had ordered him.
No one else among my men heard it for sure,
and I also said nothing to them, although worry weighed heavy on my heart,
lest they perish if they were to rebel
naked and unarmed. It is necessary to keep silent in such matters.
But the two doctors spoke to us again with their words,
urging us to dry ourselves with suitable towels,
put our clothes back on, and go to the ruler's grand house
to drink wine and enjoy a flawless feast.
However, when I took my clothes and wanted to put them on,
I found that I did not have my fejzr in my pockets, whichever it may have been,
and immediately my companions also reported the same thing to me.

We angrily asked them what had happened to our fejzrs,
and they replied with a smile in a polite manner,
that they had taken our fejzrs and placed them in safekeeping
to prevent them from being stolen. They claimed
that they would return them to us once we leave their populous star,
which was a lie. Our hearts were deeply troubled by this,
but no chance of sorrow appeared to us.
We all went out in silence, our minds filled with helplessness.
When we arrived at the king's palace,
we sat down to meat and sweet wine.
We were tough and experienced men,
having faced various battles and hardships throughout the universe.
Nothing could take away our appetite for food.
However, after we had eaten and drunk,
the cunning king rose in the midst of us and spoke:
"Now listen to my words, dear strangers, to what I shall say.
I believe that the gods have sent you to us,
for you are all very beautiful and well-built,
while we are degenerates and utterly hideous,
not daring to appear openly in the city as we naturally are;
instead, we are well-groomed and disguised with masks,
out of shame. For we are truly monstrous beings in this land.
But it is not our fault; it is our ancestors who are to blame,
who, in ages past, created an atomic bomb,
which was very effective, destroying men, cities,
and everything else terribly. One bomb wiped out
a great city. Our ancestors threw bombs at each other,
destroying the whole land and ruining everything:
animals, plants, cities with many houses,
women, men, children, and the elderly,
all knowledge, science, and technology.
Only a few people managed to save their lives
by hiding in dark holes, along with domestic animals
such as cows, goats, sheep, and horses,
as well as various others, including cats and swift dogs.
But when they emerged back into the sunlight,
they were immediately exposed to harmful radiation,
as these learned men call it, radioactive rays.


They then destroyed all their chromosomes,
causing numerous mutations in those beings,
both in men and women, as well as in other animals,
and also in plants. Our world became a dreadful spectacle.
All this happened long ago in ancient times.
The radioactive rays no longer penetrate us,
but our entire race is now degenerate and corrupted.
But you, handsome men, and all of good stature,
excellent, of tall stature, a joy to behold,
are like sculptures from the era before the nuclear age.
Therefore, I now implore you and your symmetrical heads
to stay here and save our nation,
to take our best men as husbands for your daughters,
who are powerful and wealthy in our land,
and to produce glorious and faultless offspring,
bringing you power, wealth, and respect
in our country, as to men who are rulers,
so that when you walk through the city, they will look upon you like gods.
If you are unwilling to stay here with your hearts,
I believe we will have to compel and detain you.
Now is a very suitable time and beginning for splendid marriages,
and I truly would not want it to escape my grasp."
He spoke thus. The interpreter, Franta, translated his speech entirely for us.
As we heard this, our hearts were deeply troubled
at being forced to take these monstrous women.
Secretly sighing, we tried to pray,
if perhaps some god might be alive in the depths of space,
but even so, no chance appeared to the praying.
Then, sitting quietly, we drank sparkling wine.
Where shall I begin, and what should I say first
about those abominable marriages that have now befallen us all?
How they gave all the men radiant garments,
foreign and strange, as is their custom at weddings,
and how they led us into the temple, into the house of strange gods,
to celebrate the wedding in that place and take the monstrous women as brides.
Yet none of the grooms had seen any of the brides beforehand.
It was ugly and ridiculous.
We entered the temple, and I led the extraordinary Franta on a leash,
who is the interpreter of all languages,
to translate for us the sacred words that the hierophants will say:
promises, prayers, and speeches,
as is evidently always appropriate at all weddings in all the depths of space.
But they refused to let Franta into the temple,
for he is merely an animal, and animals are not allowed inside.

Without being able to convince the sacred heads of the priests
that Franta was created by science and not by nature,
so he is not an animal, but only resembles one,
a theroid made, also called a robot.
Finally, they did not allow him to enter the sacred temple,
but the wedding ceremony was held outside the temple.
But the brides did not seem monstrous to us at all
as the king had described, but indeed they lacked charm.
They were beautiful and graceful, like movie stars,
desirable, with beautiful faces: Our hearts rejoiced at them.
There were nine girls who were given to our companions
as wives of the rich men's children, but the tenth maiden
was the daughter of King Rx-Frx-Prx, destined for me.
Her name was Grgla, and she seemed a beautiful girl,
graceful, tall, with rich blonde hair.
When I saw her, I was eager to lie with her.
And when the ceremony ended, we had a splendid feast
in the ruler's hall: plenty of meat and sweet wine.
All the grooms sat at the table with their wives
in pairs, while the other guests sat around.
But when we had all eaten and drunk our fill,
the good companions began to discreetly rise,
and they all disappeared with their brides,
for it seemed desirable to them to lie with them in bed.
But I also disappeared with my girl after the meal.
We went to the bedroom, right there in the royal house,
and when we entered, we both began to undress.
A strong desire seized me to unite in love
with the girl they had given me as a wife today.
She began to undress from her clothes, and I looked at the woman.
But when she took off her shiny clothes from her body,
she began to undress her good stature;
it was artificially made, and a dreadful and degenerate being emerged from it.
She had only one eye in the middle of her forehead like a Cyclops,
two noses and tusks, like a boar's, large and very sharp,
and she was a terrible monster.
In her body, she was hunched, and she also had four breasts,
one of each thigh much longer than the other.
Her golden hair was a deception and a result of techniques:
she had a bald head and sparse fuzz on it.
She then eagerly reached out her hands to me,
and wanting to kiss me, she puckered her thick lips.
But I, with a cry of repulsion, immediately recoiled.
She then began to chase me around the grand bedroom,
surely wanting to catch me and unite with me in love.
When she reached out to me, I struck her with powerful hands,
saving my life, for she was a terrible monster.
She then let out a mighty scream and called for her father,
to come to the bedroom and protect his daughter.
Immediately, the ruler appeared, wearing a kind of robe,
but his body was twisted and he limped with uneven steps,
but he had an artificial face on his head, it seemed.
With him, two men walked, carrying weapons in their hands.
But with great tears, she spoke to her father,
and what was to come now, she probably spoke similarly:
"Die, you Rx-Frx-Prx, who as a monster begot me,
die on the spot, for kill the man Nema,
who offended me greatly when I wanted to unite in love,
even striking me in the head with his powerful fists,
the groom of his daughter and the king who reigns wide —
he must surely die, for he has insulted the ruler himself!"
So she spoke; and the king was enraged in his sacred heart,
he ordered the guards to throw me into prison immediately.


!
They seized me roughly and led me away to the dungeon,
but the king comforted his daughter with words.
However, they dragged me out and threw me into a foul cave,
truly damp and dark and stinking, not at all pleasant.
From there, groaning, I waited for the clear dawn.
Truly, I had such pleasure from the bride on our wedding night.
When the dawn rose with the birth of pink fingers
(alien and somewhat bad, not like on Mother Earth),
two men came, who had the appearance of judges,
trying to communicate something with sounds.
But I had no ability to understand anything from them.
I gave them signs with my hands and face,
asking them to bring me Franta, who knew all languages,
so he could always translate the speeches for both sides.
They understood and left, those judicial men,
and then, returning, they brought me clever Franta,
addressing my heart with words and winged ones,
but the interpreter Franta translated all the speeches.
"To you, now, stranger, your trial and battle begin
in the hall where we always judge, as judges,
because you dishonored the daughter of the mighty king,
your wife, with whom you refused to lie in marriage,
although you are her husband and it is your duty to do so.
You also allegedly struck the king, thus dishonoring him.
The punishment for that is death, but nevertheless, we will give you a good,
honest, impartial trial, as is our custom.
You now have two hours to prepare your defense
before you enter the courtroom." So spoke one judge,
and both then left the hole.

But as I heard that, my heart was deeply saddened.
It was already certain that they intended to execute me,
since I couldn't endure entering Rx-Frx-Prxa
due to her strong resistance, for she was a terrible monster.
And then, groaning heavily, I also tried to pray,
if perhaps there might be a living god in the depths of the cosmos.
Immediately, a possibility dawned on me, although I was greatly distressed:
For the polyglot Franta had a radio transmitter directly within him,
which was directly connected to our black ship,
and also to the computer, which was the largest in the ship,
the ruler of all robots and the main system,
which is why we all called it the Emperor among sailors.
This interpreter Franta was connected to the radio by speech.
I, as well as my comrades, also had our radio transmitters,
but we left them behind inside the dark ship,
fools. But Franta had the device built-in,
as those learned electricians call it.
So I commanded the translator Franta
to connect with that large computer by radio,
and to tell it to send the robot behind us
into the courtroom, which was called Ivo.
This robot was wild and a warrior, bearer of weapons
(that type of robot which men call ROBOKOP),
equipped with many fejzrs, the bringer of terror.
He was named Ivo, and he was completely made of iron.
Now I ordered Franta to send Ivo into the hall,
to convey that message to the robot ruler within the black ship.


The message was delivered promptly, and back came the response that the robot would be sent to the hall at two o'clock. So, in good hope, we awaited the strict trial. But when two hours had completely passed, a guard entered the cell to lead me and the interpreter to the courtroom, as the necessity of it seemed. We walked towards the tower, which was also the pinnacle of the court, and then we entered inside and sat on chairs, the guards, myself, Franta, and the wise robot. In a short while, the house filled with many people, women, men, young, and old. Also, my faithful companions were led inside, one after another, albeit under armed guards, surely for spectacle, to see what would happen, what punishment would befall me, to look after their daughters. Finally, the noble judges of the people arrived ceremoniously and sat on their high chairs. As the last one, King Rx-Frx-Prx himself appeared, intending to testify. With him came Grgla, shining fiercely, carrying her deceitful beauty. A servant then blew the signal for the beginning of the trial. They all fell silent, sitting quietly. From among them, the highest judge initiated the trial, but not a word was uttered by his hoarse voice, when suddenly the war robot appeared in the large doors, and raising its arm, immediately shot the chief judge with its formidable fejzr. He became transparent and then vanished. Fear gripped everyone, but my companions applauded the robot and praised it loudly. Only the king among them addressed the robot, cursing it. The robot then shot at his splendid throne; it disappeared, and the king sat on the ground trembling. But I rose from my chair and addressed them all, commanding them to return our fejzrs if they didn't want us to kill the king immediately. Quickly, one of the guards brought us the bitter fejzrs, and I placed them in our hands and the hands of my companions. Now armed, we held the king and the people. But I stepped onto the platform and addressed them all: "Listen now to my speech, all of you, even if you suffer hardships, neither heart nor mind compels you to destroy us here. We merely do not wish to remain here with you, nor do we wish to sleep with the hideous maidens. But work awaits us in the empty spaces of the cosmos. We know that you would like us to sire glorious children in marriage to your daughters, because your ancestors destroyed everything here with nuclear bombs, animals, plants, men, and women—all. Your entire world has become a nightmare. We sympathize with you, and we do not even resent that you wanted to detain us and unite us with your women. But ahead of us lies the path through the emptiness of the cosmos. I will tell you something else, and I believe it is better. Among my comrades, there is also a wise man, a doctor, who knows complex things in his mind from natural sciences. He knows how to preserve male sperm in cold as new for a very long time, and when it thaws, how to inject it back into women. This doctor will teach you these things. We will leave much frozen sperm here in the earth and fly into space. This is advice for both sides: for us to continue traveling and for you to have glorious children." So, I spoke, and the interpreter translated my speech. Then all the leaders agreed together to accept the sperm from us and let our ship depart willingly, because the friendly fejzrs helped to reach consensus. I will not recount all the rest of the story, the complex techniques of the doctors there, because I am ashamed. In the end, we boarded the polished ship, narrowly escaping from the bed of the hideous virgins. Immediately, the rocket propulsion propelled our good ship, and upwards we flew into space, leaving the planet behind. From there, we sailed further through the abysses of the empty cosmos, searching for Mandys and the sheep that the universe follows.
