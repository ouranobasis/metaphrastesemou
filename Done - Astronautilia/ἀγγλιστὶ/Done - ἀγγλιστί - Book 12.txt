ASTRONAVIGATION SONG TWELVE
(Battle of men and women. Nemo as a captive and gladiator. Bravery of robots. Treachery of the king)
So we began to march towards that city,
armed with phasers, as I have previously said,
not alone, for with us also marched robots,
made of metal, for those made from living tissue,
5 we left behind on the ships, as they could easily be harmed
by all forms of animals, and of course, especially Franta,
a connoisseur of all languages, a true marvel of knowledge,
so that nothing would happen to him, for a great robot was valuable.
However, the appropriate language of those charming girls
10 was transferred into several small robots there by Franta,
whose purpose was one, namely to translate among
their local men and charming women.
And so we had no translator,
for we had Franta. That, fool that I was then,
15 I didn't know it would be much better to leave Franta behind
on a well-built ship, for danger was imminent.
And so we were speechless, like mute men,
neither with the local men nor with the women afterwards
could we speak anymore; it happened on its own,
20 through a series of various actions, and it was a bad thing later on.
Also among those robots walked the excellent Ivo,
our combat robot, who was the bearer of many weapons,
that robot was of the type they call ROBOKOP,
equipped with phasers as well, carriers of fear.
25 This robot was named Ivo, for he was also entirely iron.
So this robot also marched with us towards the city,
Ivo, that garment and strong protector.


We set out, as I have already said, towards the city of tailed women,
but we did not intend either war or destruction,
30 only the local men wanted to talk to us,
we carried weapons and robots only as a precaution.
But the dreadful women, who were on the city walls,
began to sound the alarm when they saw with their own eyes
men and robots approaching the city with us.
35 They did not hesitate, for fear had seized their minds.
And so many of those tailed women ran to the walls,
each of them holding a weapon in her hands,
bitter firearms, which the Greeks of later times call "rifles"
the ancients did not know them at all.*
40 With these, the women began to shoot at the newcomers.
We, startled, all threw ourselves to the ground,
to hide behind rocks, bushes, and trees,
in ditches and various holes, wherever the ground undulated;
slowly creeping forward, we shot with our deadly phasers.
45 Only Ivo the robot remained walking upright there,
as did other robots, for they did not have a program
to throw themselves to the ground when someone started shooting at them.
These robots were then targeted by the women's deadly
bullets from their weapons, and a noise arose from it.
50 However, they did no harm to those robots,
for they were made of steel and various metals, all of them.
They, walking back, also shot with deadly phasers,
many of them hitting the women themselves with difficult phasers.
Struck, they immediately became transparent like mist
55 and then disappeared altogether, and there were no more of those women.
But brave, loving battles have now been revealed,
for they did not retreat and bravely fought on,
and then they even brought out a large cannon on top of the wall,
and began to shoot from it at both robots and men.
60 They hit the robot Ivo, who was very strong in battle,
then they cruelly destroyed him and somehow mutilated him,
so that he could no longer walk and, of course, could not fight,
but fell to the ground and lay there incapacitated.
Thus the strong protection of men was now extinguished for us.
65 Other robots also shot with deadly ammunition.
But in the end, their shooting in battle was futile
with firearms, for we were still better,
for we had newer phasers, powerful weapons.
With them, we broke through the city walls and their great gates
70 with a destructive beam and entered the city,
we waved our phasers, for strong anger seized us.
They then laid down their good weapons with a great cry
and then fell to their knees and begged every man,
to spare their lives and acknowledged their defeat.
75 Immediately, as is customary throughout the universe for women,
when they are in danger and a heavy necessity befalls them,
they began to strip off their clothes, all of them at once,
offering their hidden gates of love,
confusing even the stoutest heart among those observing,
80 so they themselves undressed and joined them in love.
But now I went and sought the royal maiden,
whom I had previously made my companion in her chambers
on that day when women gave her to me as a gift of lies
(as I have already told here in the ninth song).
85 There I also recognized among the crowd of tailed women
the king, holding his knees, and so I approached him,
and as he was just undressing, I spoke featherily:
"Why, excellent one, do you want to unite in love with this
girl, whom I have already made my companion?
90 There are many other girls and women around,
for you, to consort with them, as your heart desires.
But leave this girl alone now, dear!"
Thus I spoke. He told me, the chief of men,
sighing, took away his mind or took blind rage;
95 he did not understand my words and I did not understand his,
but the situation was clear and typical:
Two men who argue here over the charms of a woman.
We stood on the wall and both prepared for battle.
But the queen woman gave us a sign to stop
100 and she also showed us that she would favor both of us,
which also happened later and I am ashamed to speak of it,
but as she promised us, it did indeed happen.
Thus in that city, my good comrades,
also the local men and their king, and I as well
105 having conquered the city, we men, engaged in erotic deeds
with the tailed women, which was also the purpose of the expedition.
So there, sinning, we stayed until darkness fell.
But when finally the sacred sunlight set
(it was foreign and unfamiliar, not like our sun),
110 fatigue seized the limbs of everyone, as well as everyone,
we all lay asleep on the walls at once.
But when sweet sleep rose for us and covered our heads,
without any guards watching over the city,
women of a foreign tribe flew to the city.
115 Large and peculiar animals carried them, strange to behold,
resembling perhaps sea ponies, but huge,
or perhaps some kind of dragons: it is hard to say for sure,
and they had large wings, like those of bats.
Sitting on these, the women flew through the air.


And there on the walls they fell and harbored anger against us,
but because we slept deeply, we lacked the strength to fight;
they quickly bound us all with bitter bonds as we slept,
all the men who were there, and also the tailed women,
and then they carried us away by flight to their own city.
125 We had no power to resist this abduction,
for our phasers were there in our clothes in our pockets,
but we were naked there because of our depraved deeds.
So lust, even though excellent, led men astray.
So they carried us, those girls, on winged dragons,
130 high in the clear sky on this divine, immortal night —
the moon of this planet also shone large and greenish today
with a terrifying brightness like the faces are rotten —
great sobbing rage and helplessness held the mind.
And then gradually, slowly, the shadowy mountains appeared,
135 their high peaks and cliffs, as well as hills,
and flying over them, the maidens and us continued,
as the mighty and dreadful dragons carried us on their backs.
Suddenly the city of tall women appeared,
and then those animals descended to the plain.
140 The hostile women, who were also tailed,
divided us bound captives into two groups there.
They led the captured women further into their city,
but they threw us men into some dark pit,
a disgusting abyss, which they had near their city.
145 We, lamenting, tried to pray,
if perhaps any god might be alive in the depths of the cosmos,
but even so, no possibility appeared to those who prayed.
So lust, even though excellent, led men astray.
Thus lamenting, we waited for the dawn to break.

When dawn broke with its rose-colored fingers
(foreign, extraordinary, unlike our own),
the enemy girl came and poured foul food
into a trough, like for wretched pigs,
and into the other, dark water for drinking,
155 and then she left, without saying a word.
She repeated the same deed every day,
and no other living creature appeared to our sad eyes.
They kept us in this pit for the entire month,
naked and emaciated like trough-fed swine.
160 There seemed to be no way to escape from the pit:
it was very steep and made entirely of hard stone,
with a sturdy grate covering the opening above.
So many of us perished inside the pit
unfortunate and emaciated, and nothing happened at all.
165 We knew nothing of the cause or meaning
of the fate of the women who were captured with us,
where they were, what they were doing, or what fate befell them,
but we were inside that pit and troubled in heart.
Eventually, the misery and boredom changed,
170 for us, the unfortunate men, to danger and fate.
When dawn broke with its rose-colored fingers
(foreign and extraordinary, unlike our own),
on that day when fate revealed death to us,
the enemy women came back to our pit,
175 armed with rifles and other weapons,
they raised the grate from the entrance and lowered a ladder inside,
indicating that we should climb out of the pit.
Some of our companions were afraid to climb out,
as were the men from the planet who had come with their king,
180 but many others wanted to escape from the pit,
for they were very bored. So the minds of men were divided.

However, Burda, the king from that planet, and I, along with other men, quickly approached the ladder, and then we climbed up and emerged from the hole. One of those women there counted us men. But when the woman had already counted ten brave men, they pulled the ladder back up and covered the opening at the top. Then they led us naked men to their city with their rifles and other weapons. It was a new morning, and all the streets were empty; the sound of our footsteps echoed in those pathways. As we walked, we marveled at the city, excellently built with white polished blocks of peculiar and unfamiliar shapes, full of peculiar little towers. They then led us to a strange building. It appeared to us like an ancient amphitheater that the old Romans used to have, where gladiators fought each other or wild animals, and where Christians once shed their dark blood under those same animals. This strange building seemed similar to us. They led us through the doors into an underground labyrinth of corridors, and then they locked us men back into some kind of crypt. They brought in a long rubber hose, the kind used to water gardens on Earth, and water poured in through the crypt's grates, cold, not warm, while the women shouted loudly. Thus, the women washed away the filth from our bodies. Then the women brought in another hose into the basin, from which warm air blew on the men. So they washed and dried us. Shortly after, we heard a loud noise, the voices of many beings, and also the voices of women. It was clear to us that women were gathering there. Then many women came into the basin. Some women held us men at bay with their weapons, while others brought armor resembling ancient armor—cuirasses, helmets, and leg guards—and ordered us to put them on for battle. We all obeyed, as they aimed their weapons at us. But they didn't give any sharp swords to the men, nor spears and shields for mighty combat. Instead, dressed in helmets and cuirasses, unarmed but with rifles and other weapons under their control, they led us through the underground maze of corridors to some low iron doors.


Then they led each man in order, one by one, into a cell that had strong bars, and there they placed a sharp sword in his hand, gave him a sturdy shield, and sent him up in the cell, like in an elevator, as the new men call it. The empty elevator descended back. And then those women took the nearest man, gave him a weapon, and sent him up, until I myself found myself in that cell. They armed me and sent me up as well. I immediately ascended from the underground maze of corridors and the technicians' power unlocked the door of the cell for me. I emerged from the cell, and it closed back behind me. Now I stood inside the arena and on the racetrack, which men also call "stadium" separately, otherwise also "circus" and otherwise "amphitheater." Around, women sat in abundance on the seats, foreign tail-bearers, but from the tribe that captured us men and women when they joined together in love. They greeted me with great cheers as I appeared, and also the other men as they emerged, carrying radiant armor, for each one was handsome and large, but when all ten men were in the circus, women with mighty trumpets blew powerful sounds. And when the third sound was released, the large doors suddenly unlocked themselves, and then ten creatures rushed out from those doors, resembling those "lžips" that the first tail-bearing women kept in their kennels, on which we achieved victory, but these were much stronger and larger than them, like great bulls, and they also had powerful tusks in their mouths, like boars or elephants, evidently terrifyingly sharp and dreadful to behold, so these pseudodogs charged fiercely against us, barking threateningly.
However, I and the other brave men,
with our swords drawn, awaited the dreadful monsters.
Now against me rushed the worst of those pseudodogs,
large, incredibly strong, dreadful just to look at.
With huge tusks in its disgusting snout,
and it leaped towards me, trying to tear me apart.
But I bent down to avoid it and struck it with my sword,
aiming for its head. Immediately dark blood gushed from its head.
The creature roared terribly and leaped at me again,
even though blood was spurting from it. It was a brave monster.
But again I struck it with my bright steel.
It roared terribly again and recoiled, a repulsive monster.
But when it rushed at me a third time with a loud howl,
its tail hit my right mighty hand,
and the sharp sword fell from my fist to the ground.
I became unarmed by the blow of the monster's tail.
I wanted to pick up the sword from the ground, but the monstrous dog
leaped at me from a distance with a huge, terrifying leap,
knocking me down and grabbing me, intending to kill me,
intending to crush me with its powerful teeth.
Then I clearly realized that a cruel fate had befallen me,
the end of life by death. But I felt no fear at all,
it just seemed strange and peculiar to me, as if in a dream,
as if it were not happening and only the seeing was,
the fate of another man, not my own.
Kind nature thus consoles our minds at the death of monsters.
Suddenly, however, the monstrous dog completely turned transparent,
and then it disappeared altogether, and there were no more monsters.
Immediately, there was also a loud scream from the tail-bearing women,
who were watching the games, as there were many in the circus.
Raising my dear limbs, I now saw with my eyes
how above the stadium the Tolma boat floated,
it had killed all those big pseudodogs down below with its powerful fejzrs,
the great monsters with which the tail-bearing women fought.
Struck, they turned transparent like mist
and then disappeared altogether, and there were no more monsters.
Immediately, the boat then landed in the middle of the circus,
and the android Ivo jumped from the boat to the ground,
a terrible robot in battle and armed with many fejzrs.
With his powerful fejzrs, he shot some of the nearby women,
who immediately disappeared, dying.
But all the other women who were watching the games,
rose with a terrible scream and wanted to flee from there
from their seats, as they sat, panic gripped them all.
Many women would have perished in panic fear,
trampled by feet as they ran in fear,
if the interpreter Franta had not jumped to the ground
and with a loud voice through the well-made megaphone
in their own language ordered them to stay in place,
if they did not want to be destroyed by the robot's fejzr.
So he spoke, and they all immediately fell silent, sitting quietly.
Then the interpreter Franta addressed their queen,
of those hostile women who sat on the throne in the middle,
and ordered her to also board the ladder to the boat,
and also the other four who were the best of them all,
and there, seated in the center, on a throne, sat the queen herself.

and there, with the queen herself, they sat in chairs in the center.
But they did not immediately obey Franta’s many words,
and then Robocop Ivo killed one of those courtiers.
Immediately, the queen and the others boarded the vessel.
320 However, once we had taken the queen as a hostage,
with the other three women, we ourselves boarded the ship.
Immediately, the rocket propulsion moved the good vessel,
and we flew back again to the land of the kind women.
And as we flew there, Franta told us everything
325 about what had happened when the women attacked us
and took the men and also those favorable to us,
women, at the very moment when we had influenced them,
to be kind to us not by magic, but by force alone,
as mysterious is the mind and soul of those women.
330 First, Franta, though a robot similar to a skunk,
roused the highest, which in Tolma was the main computer
(“computer” the British men call it by name,
but the Greeks call it “hypologistés”),
for Franta was connected to it by his bio-radiophone,
335 to that computer, which on the black ship was
the ruler of all robots and the primary logical system,
whom we all, therefore, called the Emperor.
Franta the interpreter was connected to it by radiophone.


He stirred it with words and then asked it with words,
340 to rouse Tonda the robot, who knew many
complex technical things, which was a marvel to see
to repair what might be broken in the ship,
of things: whether it was a robot or a computer,
—and Tonda looked like a great spider—
345 to send him out now to repair Ivo the robot.
The Emperor computer obeyed and immediately sent Tonda,
to repair the broken Ivo on the plain.
As soon as Tonda repaired the great and terrible Ivo,
then our ship, which we named Tolma,
350 rose up from the plain and began to search for us.
They found the great city of the women with tails,
the enemies, and found the stadium and us in it,
landing on the stadium, they then gave us rescue.
In doing so, they also captured their queen and four others,
355 to question them and hold them as hostages.
(Thus in future times, the intelligent robots will act!)
And then about the remaining things that happened later,
what shall I tell first, what next, and what at the very end?
They took their captured queen for questioning and the other
360 four remaining girls, who were captured with the queen,
while whipping them on their backs and breasts,
the king himself of the local men and those with him,
those athletes who climbed up the ridge,
as was the custom of all the tail-bearing
365 men and women, which I had long noticed,
that they all had pleasure from pain, all of them,
and for that reason, they always fought each other,
men and women and everything else with it,
like those bestial men and women also.
370—For even those men without women were born with tails
since the time when the lesbian women came to their planet,
but it was their custom to cut off those tails from all,
to clip their ears with cruel steel when young.
Thus, the tailed men did not seem to be,
375 but with the tailed women, they were the same tribe.—
The king’s leaders also listened to everything
from the captured women, and it was a wonder to hear,
but interpreter Franta translated all the speeches.
They then also told about all the other men
380 and those women they captured on the walls back then,
as well as the reasons why all this had happened.

And there with the queen herself also sat in the chairs.
They, however, did not want to heed Franta's many words at once,
and then robocop Ivo killed one of the courtiers there.
Immediately then the queen and the others went into the craft.
320 However, when we had taken the queen hostage from them,
with the other three girls, we ourselves entered the ship.
Immediately the rocket propulsion moved the good vessel,
we flew back again to the land of the kind women.
And when we were flying there, Franta told us everything
325 about what had happened when the women attacked us
and took with them men and also those favorable to us,
women, just at the time when we had subdued them,
so they would be kind to us, not by magic, but by mere force,
as the mysterious mind and soul of those women often are.
330 First, Franta, although a robot similar to a skunk,
roused the highest there, who was the main computer on Tolma
("computer" the British men call it by name,
but the Greeks call it "hypologistés"),
with this Franta was connected by his bio-radio phone,
335 with that computer, which was the ruler of all robots on the black ship
and the chief logical system, which all of us sailors
called the Emperor.
With this interpreter Franta was connected by the radio phone.



Certainly! Here is the translation while preserving the line structure:

And there with the queen herself also sat in the chairs.
They, however, did not want to heed Franta's many words at once,
and then robocop Ivo killed one of the courtiers there.
Immediately then the queen and the others went into the vessel.
320 But when we had taken the queen as a hostage,
with the other three women, we ourselves went into the ship.
Immediately the rocket propulsion moved the good vessel,
and we flew back again to the land of the gentle maidens.
And as we flew there, Franta told us everything
325 about what had happened when the maidens attacked us
and took with them the men and also those women friendly to us
just when we had made the men treat them kindly,
not by magic, but by mere force,
as mysterious is the mind and soul of those women.
330 First, Franta, although a robot resembling a skunk,
roused the chief computer there in Tolma
(“computer” the British call it by name,
but the Greeks call it “hypologistés”),
for Franta was connected to it by his bio-radiophone,
335 to that computer, which on the black ship was
the ruler of all robots and the foremost logical system,
whom we all called Emperor among the sailors.
Franta was connected to it by radiophone.
