and behold on of those who were with jesus he stretched out his hand he plucked his sword he struck the servant of the high priest he carried off his ear

then he said to him namely jesus that put away your sword to its sheath

for everyone who they take sword they will fall away on the sword

or this not do you say that there is power to me to beg my father (ⲥⲟⲡⲥ̅, ⲥⲡ̅ⲥ̅- [ⲥⲉⲡⲥ-]: to ask, to beg, to comfort)

and he will set up for me at their feet now a great extent that twelve legions of angels

therefore in what manner they will be fulfilled namely the scripture of the prophets

that it is necessary to happen also these things 

ϩⲛ ⲧⲉⲩⲛⲟⲩ ⲉⲧⲙⲙⲁⲩ ⲡⲉϫⲁϥ ⲛϭⲓ ⲓⲏⲥⲟⲩⲥ ⲛ ⲙⲙⲏⲏϣⲉ.
in that hour he said namely jesus to the crowds

that you came out to catch me in the manner of a thief with your swords and your staves (ϭⲱⲡⲉ, ϭⲉⲡ-, ϭⲟⲡ=, Q=ϭⲏⲡ: to catch; m. ⲱϫ: thief)

I was sitting daily in the temple giving teaching and you did not seize me (ⲙ ⲙⲏⲛⲉ: daily)

and all of this happened in order that they would be fulfilled namely the scriptures of the prophets

then all his disciples they left him behind they fled

ⲛⲧⲟⲟⲩ ⲇⲉ ⲁⲩⲁⲙⲁϩⲧⲉ ⲛ ⲓⲏⲥⲟⲩⲥ.
and they seized jesus

ⲁⲩϫⲓ ⲙⲙⲟϥ ϣⲁ ⲕⲁⲓⲫⲁⲥ ⲡⲁⲣⲭⲓⲉⲣⲉⲩⲥ. 
they took him to kaiphas the high priest

and the high priests and all the sanhedron they sough a false testimony against jesus

ϫⲉⲕⲁⲁⲥ ⲉⲩⲉⲙⲟⲩⲟⲩⲧ ⲙⲙⲟϥ.
in order that they might kill him

ⲁⲩⲱ ⲙⲡⲟⲩϩⲉ ⲉ ⲟⲩⲟⲛ.
and they did not find anyone

ⲉⲁ ϩⲁϩ ⲇⲉ ⲙⲙⲛⲧⲣⲉ ⲛ ⲛⲟⲩϫ ⲉⲓ ⲉϩⲟⲩⲛ.
having many false witnesses come inside 

ⲙⲛⲛⲥⲱⲥ ⲇⲉ ⲁⲩϯ-ⲡⲉⲩⲟⲩⲟⲉⲓ ⲛϭⲓ ⲥⲛⲁⲩ.
and afterward they gave their rush namely two

saying this that this man says that there is power to me to losen away the temple of god to build it in three days

and he got up namely the high priest he said to him that not you will speak

why these men make testimony against you

ⲓⲏⲥⲟⲩⲥ ⲇⲉ ⲛⲉϥⲕⲱ ⲛⲣⲱϥ.
and jesus he was abandoning his mouth

and he said to him to him namely the high priest that I make swear you of the god who is living in order that you might speak to us that you are the christ, the son of god

ⲡⲉϫⲁϥ ⲛⲁϥ ⲛϭⲓ ⲓⲏⲥⲟⲩⲥ ϫⲉ ⲛⲧⲟⲕ ⲡⲉ ⲛⲧⲁⲕϫⲟⲟⲥ.
he said to him namely jesus that you it who says it

but I say this to you from now that you will see the son of man sitting on the right of the power

ⲁⲩⲱ ⲉϥⲛⲏⲩ ⲉϩⲣⲁⲓ ⲉϫⲛ ⲛⲉⲕⲗⲟⲟⲗⲉ ⲛ ⲧⲡⲉ.
and he is coming down on the clouds of the heaven

then the high priest he tore his garment saying this that he takes blasphemy not we make need therefore of testimony from now

ⲉⲓⲥ ϩⲏⲏⲧⲉ ⲧⲉⲛⲟⲩ ⲁⲧⲉⲧⲛⲥⲱⲧⲙ ⲉ ⲡⲟⲩⲁ.
behold now you hear the blasphemy

then they cast spit into his face and they gave blows on him

ϩⲉⲛⲕⲟⲟⲩⲉ ⲇⲉ ⲁⲩϯⲁⲁⲥ ⲉϩⲟⲩⲛ ⲉϩⲣⲁϥ ⲉⲩϫⲱ ⲙⲙⲟⲥ ϫⲉ ⲡⲣⲟⲫⲏⲧⲉⲩⲉ ⲛⲁⲛ ⲧⲉⲛⲟⲩ ⲡⲉⲭⲣⲓⲥⲧⲟⲥ ϫⲉ ⲛⲓⲙ ⲡⲉⲛⲧⲁϥⲣⲁϩⲧⲕ.
and some other they gave it down on him saying this that prophesize to us now messiah that who is it that he smote you

she gave her rush to him namely a servant saying this that you yourself also you you were with jesus the galilean

and when he came out to the porch she saw him namely another woman she said to those in that place that this man he was with jesus the nazerian

ⲡⲁⲗⲓⲛ ⲟⲛ ⲁϥⲁⲣⲛⲁ ⲉϥⲣ-ⲁⲛⲁϣ ϫⲉ ⲛϯⲥⲟⲟⲩⲛ ⲁⲛ ⲙ ⲡⲣⲱⲙⲉ.
again further he denied making an oath that not I know the man

an after a little while they gave their rush to peter namely those who were standing they said to him truly you one out of them yourself

then he begain of swearing and and placing declaring down that I don't know the man

ⲁⲩⲱ ⲛ ⲧⲉⲩⲛⲟⲩ ⲁ ⲡⲁⲗⲉⲕⲧⲱⲣ ⲙⲟⲩⲧⲉ.
and immediately the rooster called

that not yet a rooster will call you will deny me three times
