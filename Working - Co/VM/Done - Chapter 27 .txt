he felt remorse he returned the 30 pieces of silver to the high priests and the elders

and the high priests they took the silver they said that it is not permited to cast them to the treasury since a price of blood it is (ⲡⲕⲟⲣⲃⲁⲛⲟⲥ: treasury [heb]; f. ⲁⲥⲟⲩ: price)

then it was completed namely that which was said through jeremias the prophet saying this that they took thirty silver the price of he who was precious (ⲧⲁⲓⲉⲟ, ⲧⲁⲉⲓⲉ-, ⲧⲁⲉⲓⲟ=, Q=ⲧⲁⲉⲓⲏⲩ: to honor, pay respect to, to estem, to regard as precious)
